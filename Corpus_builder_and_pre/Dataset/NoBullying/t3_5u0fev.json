I'm glad that I had relationships with good times. It's an experience I'm glad I had.\n\nHaving a good life is always a possibility. You don't need a \"relationship\". You just need friends, in what ever way. You don't even need many of them, just some or even one. It is not mandatory to have a best friend who you also happen to have sex with or even get children with.\n\nDon't get me wrong: I would absolutely love to have this.
