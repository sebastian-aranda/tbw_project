I&amp;#39;m happy that you are in a better place now. You have different questions that you&amp;#39;re trying to answer, whether they are about yourself or the universe or whatever, so obviously our methods are going vary. I think what&amp;#39;s important about meditation is just the act of sitting down and listening to the things that come up, and then act from there. Sounds like that&amp;#39;s what you got from CBT. As long as more people are getting to the place you got to, I don&amp;#39;t care what method they use. I only suggest meditation since it&amp;#39;s available to everybody.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you for taking the time to write your experience.
