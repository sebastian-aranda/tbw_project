It's incredibly important you keep this in mind when things seem tough. Even though life sucks at times, you're young enough that you can afford a bunch of mistakes. In fact, you should fail often in diverse ways while being mindful so that you can learn a lot (you shouldn't try to purposefully fail, but you should take risks). You can still afford to fail when you're much older, but the consequences tend to be more steep. So in summary you should fuck around as much as possible when you're still young, really experiment with the stuff you do and say so that you have a solid idea of what you naturally are (I hesitate to say something like \"knowing the REAL you\" because I don't agree with that stuff. I guess stuff that you're naturally attracted to, like things you have a knack for and also enjoy. Keep in mind that just because you're talented at something doesn't mean it's a passion, I made that mistake with CS and am now paying for it).\n\nI mention all of this because I think an important step one must take in order to foster more self-control is to realize a lot of the external events are not inherently important. I don't mean they're not important, just that they're not inherently important. In other words, a lot of the external events don't have meaning already attached to them. We give them meaning. While this may seem obvious at first, it's really something you need to learn for yourself through experience. One major mistake I made when I was much younger--around 13--was that I would read about all of this sort of stuff, but I only understood it at an intellectual level. I memorized it, I thought about it, but I didn't have experience that related to it. So the lessons would quickly drift away since I had no experience to tie them down. Compare that to the last 16-ish months where I went through a bunch of different experiences that help me intuitively understand why the stuff I read about when I was much younger was true (just turned 23 in case if you were wondering). So now I can deeply understand and embody lessons like \"don't sweat over the small stuff\" because I have enough experience to know the small shit really doesn't matter. \n\nAn actual example is how I would freak out a lot over academics. I still do to some extent, but now I don't base my self-worth or get really envious over others that do better. I went through so much personal shit and did really bad academically-speaking the last 4.5 months that I have a \"fuck it\" attitude because the personal shit waaaay over-powered the academic shit. Like I said I still care about my academics, I am a bit disappointed I did really bad this semester, but I know for a fact that my life isn't over because I did horrible this semester. I'm 23, ideally I have 50 more years ahead of me at the very least. I haven't even lived a third of my life, and to be honest I only really started living these last 4.5 months compared to the rest of what I lived. So I have a FUCKTON of life left in me (ideally). I'm even a little frightened by how much time I have left, if you can believe that! \n\nThis brings me to my next point. Even with stuff that seems really bad, keep in mind this adage \"This too shall pass.\" Nothing lasts forever, and that includes situations. We tend to focus on the bad and discount the good, so we tend to over-dramatize certain aspects of our life. I'm not saying no one has had a really shitty life, but I highly doubt someone has had a shitty life 24/7. We experience some good times too. The bad time only came because the good or neutral time from earlier ended, or that we choose to focus on the bad rather than the good or neutral. At the same time good things eventually come to an end, so you shouldn't make plans on the assumption that the good time you're in is eternal. Keep a clear mind, and not getting too attached to the current situation is an excellent way to make sure you have a clear mind. Even happiness disrupts our ability to think rationally. This isn't to say you should foster an apathetic attitude to life, that is not at all what I am saying. In fact, I think the exact opposite, that people should allow themselves to feel freely and without restraint. Just don't get too attached to the point that they control what you think or do.\n\nSo how do you actually do that? First things first, accumulate as much experience as possible. We're technically doing that as is, but most of the time we do so without being mindful of the present moment. To control ourselves we must first learn how to be aware of what we are. You also need to accumulate diverse experiences so that you don't grow too attached to a single type of experience (it's also to intuitively learn that experience itself is empty of meaning. I can give tons of examples to illustrate this point, but ultimately it's something you need to learn for yourself. A lot in how we view experiences is dependent on our mood, so that's a good place for you to start). Once you have a solid foundation to work from, I think it's time to prioritize reading up on stuff like Buddhism and stoicism (two first things that popped to mind) so that you can start to organize the lessons in your head, really cement them. Once you feel like you understand the core teachings of whatever you researched (in Buddhism, it's realizing that attachment leads to suffering) it's time to internalize them through practice. For me, it's Buddhism and learning how to not stay attached to my thoughts/feelings. Practicing mindfulness 24/7 and choosing which thoughts/feelings I should engage with starts to make mindfulness into a habit. The idea is to keep practicing until I embody mindfulness with every moment I live.\n\nChoosing whether you should engage with a feeling is a skill. And just like all skills in life, practice makes perfect. First foster mindfulness so that you are aware of your feelings. There is a bunch of stuff online that shows how you can accomplish that. Essentially use your breath as your anchor since all humans needs to breathe. Once you're mindful of your breathing you can easily expand it to your thoughts and feelings. When you slip up and let your mind wander, bring it back to your breathing and start focusing on your thoughts and feelings again. It's tough as hell at first, but eventually you make progress. The next time you have a thought/feeling and you're mindful of it, you can then choose whether you want to engage with it or not. If you don't want to engage with the thought/feeling then acknowledge its existence, but otherwise focus on your breath. It will go away with time. Don't try to mentally say stuff like \"go away\" or repeating \"no\" when they come up since it's like actively trying to not think of a pink elephant--you tend to make it more difficult. How do you forget about stuff that people literally told you a few seconds ago? You don't pay attention. So do that. Next time an unpleasant thought/feeling comes up then don't pay attention to it. Prioritize your attention on something else. Our thoughts/feelings exist because we feed them with our attention. If we deprive them of their sustenance then they must eventually die.\n\nWith enough practice you should start to get rid of your habit of constantly engaging with your thoughts/feelings. Let me reiterate that this should NOT make you apathetic to life...if it does then you're doing something seriously wrong and need to see an actual teacher. All that this should do is give you more control of whether you want to engage with a thought/feeling. It's like turning cruise control off and giving you access to the gas and brake pedals.\n\nEDIT\n\nForgot to address one more point. These last 16 months have been pretty bad for me, especially the half of August and all of September/October/most of November. Seriously, fuck the last 4.5 months. The last month has actually been pretty solid, but otherwise it's been bad overall. Like I've learned a bunch of useful shit, I wouldn't want the time to be any different except maybe my summer to consist of less video games and YouTube. Still doesn't change the fact that they've sucked a lot.\n\nWhat helped a lot is realizing I need to take personal responsibility for my life. Even for when I feel shitty, I need to take responsibility for that. Shitty stuff can happen to me, there's no questioning about that, but I am absolutely in control for how long I should feel shitty about it. And you know, it's also for stuff like my weight, how I dress, how I feel about myself overall, how I interact with others, whether I feel satisfied with my academic progress, that sort of stuff. \n\nI'm glad you're trying to gain more control over your life. There are some things we can't change (like if we like someone but they don't like us back. We can't change that, not when we truly acted like ourselves and they decided they didn't like it. You can act fake to get their interest, but it's not actually you that they like, it's the false version of you that they like), but for the stuff that we can change (like whether you should let your crush's rejection severely affect you) is something we should try our very best in getting more control over. You're living your life. You get to dictate whether you want to spend it feeling mostly satisfied/peaceful/happy, or miserable/envious/depressed.", "edited": 1483011805.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;First things first, lemme say that 19 is REALLY young.

I'm not saying we should swear off feeling other things, that's not at all what I am saying, but I think we should have the choice to feel what we want to feel. The fact that we seek this place out shows that to some extent we want this control over ourselves. So baby steps of course, but keep your eye on the prize, which is to foster mindfulness over what we think or do so that we can start to identify the roots that are responsible for our perspective. With knowledge of what's responsible can we begin to develop an idea on how to change for the better. Anyways, develop this mastery over yourself and you begin to feel liberated from things that would normally dictate your behavior. Instead of feeling pissed and having your day ruined by some asshole, wouldn't it be awesome to instead smile and help the asshole by treating them with compassion, thereby potentially healing whatever caused the individual to act so nasty? It's incredibly self-empowering to know you are capable of acting in such a manner, and even choose to do so. \n\nSomething to keep in mind.
