We progressed to pretending that and invisible man was karate kicking the shit out of us and she absolutely loved that.  We were eventually told to calm down with the comedy act because it was starting to hinder her learning, which we understood.   But that didn&amp;#39;t stop us from being Zoey&amp;#39;s personal group of laugh material.  We came up with many different ways to amuse her and it worked everytime.  She would cry laughing and we would feel like awesome people for keeping Zoey happy.  The next year she switched schools and I never found out what happened to her after 3rd grade.  But I use the same laugh material I used with Zoey on my little cousins and they go nuts for it.  I was so happy to have an experience like that because it&amp;#39;s such a feel good experience of my life that never fails to make me smile when thinking about it.
