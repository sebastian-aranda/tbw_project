If you see any similar interests, don't hesitate to send me a message!\n\nHello! My name is James! Here's a list of the various silly things I'm interested in!\n\n* Sports! Basketball, baseball, football and a bit of Premier League soccer mostly.\n\n* Game of Thrones/ASOIAF!\n\n* Star Wars!\n\n* Television! Outlander, Vikings, Black Sails, The Last Kingdom, Westworld, This Is Us, Rick and Morty, Always Sunny, and The Great British Bake Off!\n\n* Books! My goal this year is to read 30 books, so I'm always interested in finding new things to read :D\n\n* Movies! I try to keep up with most of the Oscar movies at least, but I've been making an effort to see a lot more movies over the past couple years. So far I've seen 40 from 2016 and I still have a bunch to catch up on! I'm working my way to becoming an amateur film buff!\n\n* Video games/Youtube! I'm a college student, so I mostly only play PC games when I even have the time to, but I love watching things like Achievement Hunter and Funhaus!\n\n* Collecting! I'm one of those people who love having physical embodiments of the things I love, so I've spent a few years gathering up some Thrones mini figures, sports memorabilia, and recently the Star Wars Black Series figures :D\n\n* The outdoors! Despite all that stuff I love taking place mostly indoors, I do love being outside. I haven't had the time or money to travel anywhere too crazy yet, but someday I want to see a lot more of the world. For now, I'm content with the hiking trails I can find nearby!\n\n* History! I'm pretty new to learning anything more than what I learned in high school history, but I've listening to this great British History Podcast recently that has taught me so much! Which brings me to my next point...\n\n* Podcasts! I listen to music occasionally, but my main listening interest is podcasts. I have a long list that I listen to, so I'll just share that if anybody is interested since I've typed quite a lot here already!\n\nI know that was a ton of reading, but well, that's pretty much everything about me. Maybe you have a new book or new show to suggest for me and maybe I have one for you too!

If you see any similar interests, don&amp;#39;t hesitate to send me a message!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hello! My name is James! Here&amp;#39;s a list of the various silly things I&amp;#39;m interested in!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sports! Basketball, baseball, football and a bit of Premier League soccer mostly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Game of Thrones/ASOIAF!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Star Wars!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Television! Outlander, Vikings, Black Sails, The Last Kingdom, Westworld, This Is Us, Rick and Morty, Always Sunny, and The Great British Bake Off!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Books! My goal this year is to read 30 books, so I&amp;#39;m always interested in finding new things to read :D&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Movies! I try to keep up with most of the Oscar movies at least, but I&amp;#39;ve been making an effort to see a lot more movies over the past couple years. So far I&amp;#39;ve seen 40 from 2016 and I still have a bunch to catch up on! I&amp;#39;m working my way to becoming an amateur film buff!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Video games/Youtube! I&amp;#39;m a college student, so I mostly only play PC games when I even have the time to, but I love watching things like Achievement Hunter and Funhaus!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collecting! I&amp;#39;m one of those people who love having physical embodiments of the things I love, so I&amp;#39;ve spent a few years gathering up some Thrones mini figures, sports memorabilia, and recently the Star Wars Black Series figures :D&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The outdoors! Despite all that stuff I love taking place mostly indoors, I do love being outside. I haven&amp;#39;t had the time or money to travel anywhere too crazy yet, but someday I want to see a lot more of the world. For now, I&amp;#39;m content with the hiking trails I can find nearby!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;History! I&amp;#39;m pretty new to learning anything more than what I learned in high school history, but I&amp;#39;ve listening to this great British History Podcast recently that has taught me so much! Which brings me to my next point...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Podcasts! I listen to music occasionally, but my main listening interest is podcasts. I have a long list that I listen to, so I&amp;#39;ll just share that if anybody is interested since I&amp;#39;ve typed quite a lot here already!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know that was a ton of reading, but well, that&amp;#39;s pretty much everything about me. Maybe you have a new book or new show to suggest for me and maybe I have one for you too!

I am currently reading a book about parts of chinese philosophy as well as my 3rd take on &amp;#39;The Art of War&amp;#39; (Sun Tzu), and it helps to do small bits but regularly if the text is huge (especially when you are reading things like german philosophers, be strong. And be patient).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do you go on long travels once in a while? I think I have learned an awful lot of stuff from books I read during flights to see my girlfriend. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You may please keep typos, you can even get a second helping for free! &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "stickied": false, "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "wholesomememes", "score_hidden": true, "subreddit_type": "public", "name": "t1_ddmqw2x", "created": 1486888350.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1486859550.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wholesomememes", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ddmp29m", "banned_at_utc": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "MaddieMooTrain", "can_mod_post": false, "ups": 1, "parent_id": "t1_dd8cgko", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "Hi Doctor_Tiger!
