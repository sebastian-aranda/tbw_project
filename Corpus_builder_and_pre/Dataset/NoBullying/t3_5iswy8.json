Gone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The cop asked if he could prove he owned the car by stating his license plate number. They both started laughing, and said &amp;quot;did you know that &lt;em&gt;most people don&amp;#39;t even know their own license plate number?&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cop got angry, looked at the car, and asked what they were carrying in the trunk.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They laughed harder, and said &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;chicken manure and canoe paddles!&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The cop angrily asked them to pop the trunk, and walked back to check it out for himself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Without a word, that policeman walked back to his car, and drove away. To this day, the guy thinks that he and his friend were probably sent to lighten up that cop&amp;#39;s day.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "stickied": false, "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "wholesomememes", "score_hidden": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "name": "t1_dbatfb3", "created": 1481985802.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1481957002.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wholesomememes", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dbarvwi", "banned_at_utc": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ezk3626", "can_mod_post": false, "ups": 16, "parent_id": "t1_dbaru4l", "score": 16, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "Tell me more ;-)", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": true, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tell me more ;-)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "stickied": false, "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "wholesomememes", "score_hidden": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "name": "t1_dbarvwi", "created": 1481982313.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1481953513.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wholesomememes", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dbaru4l", "banned_at_utc": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "sloppyjoes7", "can_mod_post": false, "ups": 17, "parent_id": "t3_5iswy8", "score": 17, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "I once heard a (PhD) Sociologist say that the best way to get somebody to fall in love with you is to genuinely listen to them.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I once heard a (PhD) Sociologist say that the best way to get somebody to fall in love with you is to genuinely listen to them.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "stickied": false, "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "wholesomememes", "score_hidden": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "name": "t1_dbaru4l", "created": 1481982212.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1481953412.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wholesomememes", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3gcwj", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5iswy8", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dbb5skm", "banned_at_utc": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "AfterThoughtLife", "can_mod_post": false, "ups": 2, "parent_id": "t3_5iswy8", "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "This is me every time my friend is like, \"sorry to put this all out on you.\"", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is me every time my friend is like, &amp;quot;sorry to put this all out on you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "stickied": false, "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "wholesomememes", "score_hidden": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "name": "t1_dbb5skm", "created": 1482020037.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1481991237.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wholesomememes", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null}}], "after": null, "before": null}}]
