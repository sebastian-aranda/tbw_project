There's several stages we can generally summarize treatment plants into, hopefully I'll remember it in the proper order:   \n1) Water comes in and undergoes **rapid mixing**. At this point, the water is treated to adjust pH (we like our water neutral afterall!) and a coagulant to help impurities stick together (dirt, particles, etc. even stuff our eyes can't see at first glance)  \n2) Then it flows into a **flocculation** basin where water is slowed down and the impurities (referred to as floc) have time to stick together and grow  \n3) From there it enters a **sedimentation basin** where the floc has had time to build up long enough that it will actually sink to the bottom and gently be (mechanically) removed (as to not break the floc up)  \n4) After the big stuff comes out, it'll enter a **filtration** system made of sands, gravels, etc. Water flows through here and removes remaining microscopic particles and small microorganisms that might be making it through. The filtration system has to be backwashed to clean all of this out time to time to keep it from building and blocking up.  \n5) Lastly, it gets disinfected with chemicals [**disinfection**], such as a combination of chlorine and ammonia, and yes, fluoride too for dental health. These chemicals protect the water from bacteria growing in it. The amount of chemicals introduced has to be carefully determined so your residual in the system lasts an appropriate amount of time. You keep a residual of chemicals in the system to prevent bacteria or anything from growing in the water while its being distributed, but you don't want it to be in the water too long or else byproducts begin to form. If you ever hear talk about water age in a system, water age is a overarching way to analyze water quality in a broad stroke, because after *I think* it's 3 days in a Free Chlorine system or 7 days in a Chloramine system, the water will start forming byproducts and degrade in quality. In most systems, you can probably bet on water being 24-48 hours old in all areas but the outskirts of the system.   \nAs for why water is so cheap, because of chlorine disinfection which is chlorine is cheap, widely available, and we do it in bulk!  \n**Bonus information:** While UV disinfection kills and sterilizes everything, a system can not purely treat using UV in their plants because it leaves no residual. So while the best for immediate treatment (it's costly though), they still have to add chlorine to it.   \n**Bonus overview info on Flint, Michigan:** The big issue with Flint was the mixing of water from two different sources and the chemical composure of them. Effectively what happened was Flint traditionally used Source A for a long time. Over time, pipes get a build up on the lining of the pipes that is going to be unique to the system based on the water coming in (you know, such as amount of iron, calcium, etc, that kind of stuff). When Flint introduced Source B, the chemical composure of the water was different and they didn't account for the way this affects the interior of the pipe.

There&amp;#39;s several stages we can generally summarize treatment plants into, hopefully I&amp;#39;ll remember it in the proper order:&lt;br/&gt;\n1) Water comes in and undergoes &lt;strong&gt;rapid mixing&lt;/strong&gt;. At this point, the water is treated to adjust pH (we like our water neutral afterall!) and a coagulant to help impurities stick together (dirt, particles, etc. even stuff our eyes can&amp;#39;t see at first glance)&lt;br/&gt;\n2) Then it flows into a &lt;strong&gt;flocculation&lt;/strong&gt; basin where water is slowed down and the impurities (referred to as floc) have time to stick together and grow&lt;br/&gt;\n3) From there it enters a &lt;strong&gt;sedimentation basin&lt;/strong&gt; where the floc has had time to build up long enough that it will actually sink to the bottom and gently be (mechanically) removed (as to not break the floc up)&lt;br/&gt;\n4) After the big stuff comes out, it&amp;#39;ll enter a &lt;strong&gt;filtration&lt;/strong&gt; system made of sands, gravels, etc. Water flows through here and removes remaining microscopic particles and small microorganisms that might be making it through. The filtration system has to be backwashed to clean all of this out time to time to keep it from building and blocking up.&lt;br/&gt;\n5) Lastly, it gets disinfected with chemicals [&lt;strong&gt;disinfection&lt;/strong&gt;], such as a combination of chlorine and ammonia, and yes, fluoride too for dental health. These chemicals protect the water from bacteria growing in it. The amount of chemicals introduced has to be carefully determined so your residual in the system lasts an appropriate amount of time. You keep a residual of chemicals in the system to prevent bacteria or anything from growing in the water while its being distributed, but you don&amp;#39;t want it to be in the water too long or else byproducts begin to form. If you ever hear talk about water age in a system, water age is a overarching way to analyze water quality in a broad stroke, because after &lt;em&gt;I think&lt;/em&gt; it&amp;#39;s 3 days in a Free Chlorine system or 7 days in a Chloramine system, the water will start forming byproducts and degrade in quality. In most systems, you can probably bet on water being 24-48 hours old in all areas but the outskirts of the system.&lt;br/&gt;\nAs for why water is so cheap, because of chlorine disinfection which is chlorine is cheap, widely available, and we do it in bulk!&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Bonus information:&lt;/strong&gt; While UV disinfection kills and sterilizes everything, a system can not purely treat using UV in their plants because it leaves no residual. So while the best for immediate treatment (it&amp;#39;s costly though), they still have to add chlorine to it.&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Bonus overview info on Flint, Michigan:&lt;/strong&gt; The big issue with Flint was the mixing of water from two different sources and the chemical composure of them.
