I&amp;#39;d be super-glad if all parties got their respective cats fixed. I hope all related offspring had willing and loving homes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have 13 cats, folks. All strays or litters of kittens from strays that occurred at my house in the past 2 years. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t want this many cats. But I love them and feel I, as a human, am responsible for any homeless cat I find that show up on my property. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I understand preaching is kinda shitty on such a wholesome subreddit, don&amp;#39;t get me wrong. I just think our animal buddies are super important and I can&amp;#39;t help but care for them a ton. We need to step up and be responsible where past humans have let our friends down!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: this sub is really awesome.
