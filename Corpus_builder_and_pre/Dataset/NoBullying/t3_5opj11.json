I've done Yoga for years, but mostly just as a way to stay limber not that I'm no longer practicing gymnastics, and I never really thought too much about the mindfulness aspects of that until I actually started meditating separately. The whole 'take a breath and *be*' thing shows up in a lot of places.\n\nMindfulness meditation isn't too far off from Cognitive Behavior Therapy either, and they're often recommended hand-in-hand. They both come down to retraining the way your mind reacts to stimuli, and there's a lot of evidence supporting their helpfulness.
