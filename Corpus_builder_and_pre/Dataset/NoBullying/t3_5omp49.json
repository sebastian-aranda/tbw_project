Remember that people are not identical reflections of their candidates, and that you can't guess somebodies exact beliefs or personality based off of their political party or candidate. (For example, I'm a staunch Republican, but also pro-choice, agnostic, and a supporter of universal basic income. People come in all sorts of flavors, never be too quick to judge :)\n\nI'm also in the process of teaching myself ukulele, maybe I'll learn my guitar someday too. It's easier to pick up and play a ukulele than a fat ol guitar though haha.\n\nFoot-footnote: I'm not an artistic person but I really want to learn how to do something artsy. If anyone has an art form to suggest that I try I'd love to hear it. And I kinda want to learn how to juggle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "edited": 1484873640.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi there, I&amp;#39;m Swagularity.
