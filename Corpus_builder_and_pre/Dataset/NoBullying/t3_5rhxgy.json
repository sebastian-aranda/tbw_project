Sincerely. \n\nLike, \"ubiquitous\" means something that is universal in terms of placement or appearance; commonplace. Almost like \"everywhere.\" E.g. \"Smartphones are ubiquitous\" because they're commonplace and everywhere.  \n\nThe definition of \"meme\" is not really \"ubiquitous.\" \n\nThe definition you provided boils down to \"a meme is an idea or expression that goes viral and gets replicated.\" An example would be the \"keep calm and carry on\" phrase from years ago. That's a meme and wholesome too, because it was spread everywhere and sent a wholesome message. \n\nAlso, \"meme\" doesn't really mean \"image macro,\" (nor are image macros necessarily memes, unless the underlying image is something popular or widely recognized, like success baby. Though the format itself is arguably a meme) and there really isn't a \"meme format.\"  Memes are basically ideas that go viral. :)\n\nI suggest changing the recommendation to \"we recommend you to follow the image macro format\" if you're looking for pictures with words on top and bottom as the only submissions. \n\nI'm trying to help people remember what \"Meme\" really means, especially since Richard Dawkins coined it, and intended it to be treated like a gene, which replicates repeatedly, like a viral idea would.
