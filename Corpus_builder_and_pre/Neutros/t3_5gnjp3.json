My youngest sibling is the only one of us who stills sees him, every other weekend visiting rights, and my sibling says my father has changed. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have seen time and again &amp;quot;you will miss the relationship you could have had.&amp;quot;, but I don&amp;#39;t feel that with how my father and I were. He loved me, but the his way or the highway mentality, always living in fear of him hitting me if I stepped out of his designated line, or the fact that he never listened has tarnished any thought of reviving a relationship with him. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t feel like I will lose anything when he&amp;#39;s gone. I don&amp;#39;t have any unanswered questions, or a need to say &amp;quot;I love you&amp;quot; one last time because I dont. I don&amp;#39;t love him. And I am a better man than I would have been if I stayed under his rule. His parenting has made me say &amp;quot;I will never be like him to my kids.&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I say all of this, listening to &amp;quot;you will miss the relationship you could have had.&amp;quot;, but I&amp;#39;m still bitter about it 9 years later.
