Made anymore clocks lately?
Hey I know you! You're the kid that keeps buying grass clippings from me for $80/oz. 
I'm surprised you were able to figure out how to post on this subreddit seeing as you don't know how to tuck in your shirt correctly.
Damn you look like the next cast member on Degrassi with your racially ambiguous ass
God that nimble left wrist makes you any Priest's dream
Dude, what the fuck is up with your left arm !!!
If I knew kids like you smoked weed I wouldn't have started. Dweeb. 
You look like the kid whos parents have to buy them the Jordan knockoffs from the dollar store because they made horrible life choices when they were younger, (i.e. you).
probably took you three hours to get the perfect tucked-to-untucked ratio with your shirt
You definitely went through less checks at the border than there are on your shirt.
