&gt; Hi fam, this is my friend. He's hosting a roast for his birthday but doesn't think any of our friends are good enough to roast him. Fire away :)  He wrote, alone on his birthday. 
"Your Friend"? Where did you pick him up from, the special olympics? How much is he paying you?
Constipated?
You're the face of special Olympics soccer. I bet you have every participation award there is. 
It must be difficult to be friends with horse mouth there without worrying that he will bite at your fingers
Your neck is at least twice as long as it should be. 
From the looks of it, your room has more personality than you do.
Can Retarded Ronaldo count to potato?
You should give him an extra chromosome instead 
The fact that he is   1. Hosting his own birthday party 2. Organizing his own roast 3. Doesn't think his own friends are clever enough to hurt his feelings  say more than enough, but I'll add that he looks like he gets jealous of toilets because at least girls want to piss and shit in their mouths 
I think he should host a search party for his chin instead.
Lookin like a pedophile Jared from subway oh wait...
We can plainly see by the condition of the bed that there was  some action a happenin!
