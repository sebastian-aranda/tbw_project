Let me correct your title &gt;My friend Rhys, UK power~~lifter~~ bottom
You look like an asian with normal eyes
Must take some real power to lift those tits
Lifting dicks to your mouth isn't a type of powerlifting.
Is he one of those *special* lifters I've been hearing about?
Which one is your friend? All I see are a couple of monkeys.
Switching to KG doesn't make your lifts any heavier or you less fat
The only powerlifting this kid is doing is getting his fat ass from the couch to the fridge.
His face seems to have power to cover that giant double-chin around.
The only thing he's power lifting is donuts into his face
What is he lifting? Dicks?
Hey look a chimp wearing an article of clothing... and holding a roast me sign.
If your head was flipped upside down you would look exactly the same.
Tell your friend he needs to powerlift his nose from sinking into his face.
I'm diggin the self-portrait on your shirt
Lifting your tray at McDonald's doesn't count as lifting.
I'm confused are we supposed to be roasting the monkey or the ugly mess above it?
You look like you've eaten so much pig you're starting to become one. Also is that a cross on your middle finger?
