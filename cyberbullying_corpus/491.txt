Last one is too damn good 
Wait a minute, how in the world can pick_ locks_ get_money not have been highlighted a single time in any of these three best ofs? That guy kills it in almost every single thread - he's an artist!
those roasters who made the list, your flair has been updated.
How did the (paraphrasing) "Folded flag is atop your mom's Christmas list" for the soldier submission not make it?  That shit was brilliant.  These are just ok.
This still gets to me.  https://www.reddit.com/r/RoastMe/comments/3nhk1e/shes_a_model_roast_her/cvoa98u?context=3
The extra chromosomes one made me spit my drink.

Did the one where people refused to roast, because it was too easy, get taken down? It was up pretty high but it may have been some "special" folk. 
It's true. When I did my /r/roastme, I got a large number of responses. All with the same 3 jokes. Joker/convict/rapist was all anyone had to say. And at least I have a facial scar to give them the Joker angle. I can only imagine how sad the threads are for those without one. I ended up dominating my own roast. It was sad.

This needs to be an official Monthly thing.  It's awesome..
So much roasting going on I want to make me some ribblits
Number 9 takes the cake for me.

Number 5 was the best imo
you're meant to bake pilsbury dough, not roast it
Honestly, /r/roastme is getting softer.
What happened? These used to be funny.  
These compilations are the best posts here
\#3 "Did you draw your face?"  Weak. Otherwise, these are hilarious.
My butt hurts that I had the top post on 7 but mine wasn't chosen. I do gotta admit that the two comment combo was pretty good though.
That mustache looks like a shock absorber for a high speed cocksucker.
As usual, these are all shit.
