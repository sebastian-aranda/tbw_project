Does he keep all his confidence in that monolith above his eyebrows? 
He looks like someone who'd go to coffee shops and name drop celebrities while talking loudly on his cell phone. 
Your friend is a piece of shit.
I'd have that dead look in my eyes if I was your friend too.
Let him have it. He'll need it in 3 years when he confidently tells people he keeps his head bald by choice.
Forehead bigger than the Sahara Desert
Da fuck?! Who doesn't own a mirror?
You should work on a hairstyle that covers that Neanderthal forehead. 
And I'm confident that he loves the cock. 
Am I the only one who thinks he looks like scumbag steve? Only faggier.
He's only confident because hasn't been caught by Chris Hansen yet
Jesus I can smell his body odor from here, does he shower or just rub patchouli oil on his massive forehead and call it a day?
