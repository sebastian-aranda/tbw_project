Is that a promise ring? Is the promise to never take a shower?
You look like the kind of girl that's the only one not drinking at the party and "still having just as much fun"
Your teeth are a solid A4.  You're a cosmetic dentist's wet dream.  I hope whatever secretary job you end up getting has dental benefits. 
You're plainer than unsalted butter on white bread.
On its 1st steps to becoming the jagged yellow stained meth mouth that culture demands !!
You've perfected the art of looking Amish despite having access to modern niceties like make up, shampoo and a tooth brush.
Why do you look like the kind of girl who always  tells her boyfriends "i want to wait 'til marriage" and then gets drunk off one smirnoff ice at your first party in college and lets an international business major fingerbang you? 
You have the under the eye bags of a 60 year old diabetic man. 
You look like a younger Chris Cooper (late 30's maybe?), but without the makeup (and with one hand on one of those clear static-charged balls at science museums). Nice frizzy hair, loner.
You dont need a promise ring to say you are going to be a virgin until marriage 
You remind me of one of the aliens from the movie Cocoon. http://imgur.com/xQ1X3FC
Waxing your eyebrows a while back really turned out to be a bad idea, huh?
You look like the designated muncher at a lesbian party.
Didn't your mom teach you not to chew with your mouth open? Swallow all of that corn, hillbilly. 
Powder has a sister?
Credit where credit is due.  Most women who look like you would use a ton of makeup to make themselves look attractive. Congratulations on not bait-and-switching on some poor young man.
I would, but it looks like genetics has roasted you enough as it is.
