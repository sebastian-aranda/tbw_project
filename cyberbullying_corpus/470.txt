You look like the kind of guy who laughs really hard just cos everyone else is until someone says "but you weren't even there?" And you pull this fucking face
You PC bro?
With your golf poster and backwards hat you look like every generic frat boy.
At least Tiger could get with girls
You look like the white guy that calls every black dude bro and tries an overcomplicated handshake.
Aren't you a little too old to be in a dorm?
Yeah? Well, your sweat smells like cinnamon... Shit!
