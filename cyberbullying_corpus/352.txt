Red shirt guy literally has a human foot for a torso. His head being the only toe.
Pubescent boy #1 with the 17 individual hairs attempting to be a goatee needs to stop biting his nails like they're his food source.  Doughy pubescent boy #2 with even less facial hair on his chinny chin chins, stop with the "muscle" shirt.  You need to have muscle, not dough.
Both of you look like your about to be killed by a firing squad
Well... looks like the scout master had good taste then.
No one is stupid enough to touch a boy scout who just got parole.
You both put the DUR in Tyler Durden.
He must have seen that you two had each other covered. Remember to wrap it up boys
and yet you're still crying about it...   I'll just presume you two roleplay various very special episodes from 80s sitcoms, like Wesley and the Counselor from Mr. Belvedere.  Actually, I'm half convinced red shirt is Tina Yothers.
The first photo of you reminds me of a flea-bitten rat. You're fatter and uglier in the second photo, taken after the "incident" when Jared from Subway force-fed you sandwiches in his sex dungeon, catcalling you, "Five Dollar Fatty." 
No eagle scout rank? I'm guessing red shirt couldn't achieve personal fitness and black shirt couldn't even get past the pinewood derby cars.
You two make me wish Hitler would come around  for round 2 to clean up the gene pool
Scoutmaster tried, but he just wanted to rub some Oxy 10 on your faces
Which ones the big spoon?
The Scout Master didn't touch you for a reason. Y'all look like you have fuckin hepatitis. 
Bullshit, the Scout Master had them many time. And they are returning the compliment to the new crop of kiddies.
Both were Scout Leader playtoys.  No harm done. Just one of those things that  makes a young boy turn into a douchebucket.
