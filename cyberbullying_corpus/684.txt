I'm sorry your mom died a year ago
Stick with kissing boys. It fits you much better.
Your eyebrows are about 5 hairs short of kissing eachother, so at least part of you will get some action soon
Over a year! Damn, son, one tenth of your life! 
Get used to it 
Yeah but how many boys have you kissed in that time? I bet that is also zero cus that face. 
Why the dry spell?  Your hooker fund must have ran out.
I bet I won't have to. You'll cry yourself to sleep anyway.
I bet you cry yourself to sleep because you're worthless and un kissable. It's okay though. You'll never find love because you're nose if fucked up like your eyebrows and you're an ugly piece of shit. NO ONE WILL LOVE YOU. EVER. (of either gender.) Because you'll never be worth it.  You'll die alone as a 92 year old obviously aging virgin.
