You have nicknames for all 12 hairs in that mistake of a mustache.   
you're probably not allowed near children.
How do the girls decide between the vermin on your shirt and the shit-stache on your lip?
Some people are accused of pasting their own pubes on their face, but you went the extra step and used your rat's pubes.
I guess owners really do resemble their pets
Its a mistake letting them sleep with you, they are moulting all over your lip. 
I remember when I was going through puberty and wanted to have a moustache so I trimmed my pubes and glued them on my face
Awww.. the owner dressed one of his rats as a human for Halloween. 
It's the face he makes right after he crawls out of his anal cavity 
Thats how he looks when he picks up rat chicks.
You mean your asshole has no bounds being that those 2 gerbils were just up it?
"My positivity has no bounds"? Is that what you tell your pet rat before you molest it?? That's a rat fuckers mustache if I ever saw one.  
Yep, that's exactly the kind of person who has a pet rat.
You may have no bounds but you sure do have Downs
Rats on the shoulders and gerbils in the ass.  Quality roast.
Is this where we guess how many rats are inside you?
2 rats, 1 guy, 3 sets of rat whiskers.
Those little shits are great on white bread.
your rat is sad you're too short for the fall from your shoulder to be fatal
