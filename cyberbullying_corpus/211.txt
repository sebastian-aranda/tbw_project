Do you still get royalties for appearing in WALL-E? I see they let you keep the chair. 
An ashtray full of cigarettes, a food tray that says 'Raw' on it, and your fat-self.  My head is going into overload trying to comprehend how you're still alive.
It's nice of the nurse to try to help sit you up and take the picture for you.
You look like you laid back so far that you couldn't wiggle back up, and now you're trying to expedite your death by smoking multiples at a time
Comic book guy got glasses. 
If I hit you with my best shot, I'd lose my hand.
Looks like you're experienced at taking shots to the face 
The only shot you should be concerned about is the Nitroglycerin after your 4th heart attack
With that belly any hit would not bottom out.....
I looks like you'd just absorb all my shots so I'm not going to bother 
Nah I think I need to hit you with a diet plan
Good lord, you're so repulsively obese that you have your own gravitation push.
Morbidly obese and a smoker, thats a healthy combo. 
You are a disgusting human being. Everything about you says I don't try. You can't even get your fat ass up to even go outside and smoke. The only reason your hair is short is so you don't have to lift your arms to do anything with it 
With your size I can hit you with any shot
the only way you should be roasted is with an apple in your mouth  so what do you think is going to kill you first, cancer or a heart attack?  why is that ashtray so full? did you eat the maid?  
I would hit you with my best shot, but it would just bounce right off.
