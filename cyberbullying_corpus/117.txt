UnCoolio
that's a hairstyle chosen just to fuck with the police sketch artist.
You work at a fast food place and your shirt hangs down to your knees.  I have no doubt your grandma raised you.
40 years old and working at a fast food restaurant. He's roasting himself.
Your homies from the joint miss your cooking....and shower time.
One of Michello Obama's chef's no doubt, by the looks of the dirty kitchen
Is his birthday wish to finally meet his father for the first time?
Two things in this picture are identical: that overflowing garbage can and your disgusting hair.
The look in your eyes says "you are going to *get some* tonight." to the person taking the picture.   Your smile, on the other hand, says "and it's happening whether you want it to or not."
You look like a young Cleveland Brown. 
So what kind of hairstyle do you want? "Dune... we must protect the spice!"
