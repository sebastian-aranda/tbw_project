Roast you? I havn't unlocked you yet!
The lighting did everyone a favor here.
EVEN THE LIGHT IS AFRAID OF YOUR FACE
Change your lightbulbs, damn.
I'll just hide in the shadows and troll the internet for 12 year old boys.
Yup, I'd lend you some heavy-duty sandpaper to scrub them dirt off of your face
Yer name is Toby. 
Good thing you have shitty lighting, because your face has more texture than your ceiling.

No light, paper covering face.....I would do all of the same things if I was absolutely  devastated when I looked in the mirror every morning too.
