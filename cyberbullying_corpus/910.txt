you look like lil kev from always sunny
At least you have something to beat off on.
THERE'S A NUTSACK ON MY DRUMSET!!!
Meg White is a better drummer. 
Next time you smoke a joint, dip it in some gasoline
You're off white smile suggests you've been chewing dynamite... Or black scrotum 
Your only in the band out of pity, but in reality your drumming is the reason why the only gig you ever played was for a bingo game at a retirement home
Good thing you're already hitting those skins, you're going to be beating your meat for a long time.
I didnt know you could find drumkits in special needs schools...good for you man
Never let Lars Ulrich breed. 
Oh the kid in the helmet got his helmet off, somebody help him.
You smile to appear half decent, but not only does that fail horribly due to your teeth, it also fails because it's obvious that you have no real friends that care about you and you know it. You go on here just because you want people to confirm what you already feel for a long time. You're not popular and you're not 'the hated guy'. You're just the nobody that wouldn't be missed.
