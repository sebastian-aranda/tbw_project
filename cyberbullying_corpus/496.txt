He says I cant get to him. Did he also mention no one can get to his virginity? 
Are you Stephen Hawking hidden son?
You look like an 8th grade science teacher and a pedophile.

Maybe we wont get to him but skin cancer will
He wore his best pedophile clothes, and he only has 3 more payments to make on his cargo van. Look out little boys.
I can't get to him.  And I'll be honest, I don't want to.  I actually want to be as far from him as possible.
Guy Smiley from Sesame Street?! 
Just because you're rejected a role on teen nick doesn't mean you get free karma.
I definitely can't get to him, but he seems more than willing to let Lexington Steel get close enough

Your mother opens her legs the same way. 
I guess a dick in a box was too big for you?
You look like the type of person who would vote for Donald Trump
This dude is stickman.

Why such a large sign? You could just as easily cover it with a sticky note.
