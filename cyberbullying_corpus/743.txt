So this is where the magic happens, eh?
Don't listen to the people mocking your unmade bed. I know it isn't yours, because there's no fucking way you'd fit on it.
The hair from your mexi-stache seems to have illegally migrated up to your eye brows. 
More like fatkid need an enema and a good diet plan
That bed, that look, that inevitable conclusion is I walk---

This is the kid who's really mean to everyone until they hit their growth spurts then he's the weird looking short fat kid everyone can beat the crap out of.
You look like Rosie O'Donnell with less facial hair and downs syndrome
its seth mcfarlane's disabled brother...he doesn't speak of him, because he was once raped by him on christmas day, under the tree...
With that eyebrow/lazy eye combo, I can't tell if you are intrigued or just confused...or maybe just dumb
Looks like one of Seth Macfarlane's failed attempts to clone himself

You know you don't actually get a roast right?
You look cold without your trench coat 
FUCK I can't focus on anything except for the fact that you used that stupid fucking graph paper.  Just use normal fucking paper you dumb bitch
I'm willing to bet money that you wear tap-out shirts from Wal-Mart and listen to AC/DC. 
Next year I'm going as you for Halloween. 
You look like a pillow rapist.
