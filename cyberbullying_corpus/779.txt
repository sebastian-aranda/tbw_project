You look like the kind of guy who tells everyone about his girlfriend, but when people ask who she is, your answer is "you don't know her, I met her at camp."
You got turds growing from ur cheeks
Cant, you are already well-done
Why the long face?

You may call me a basement dweller in your title, but from the looks of those cheeks you seem to be spending a lot of your time in the kitchen.
We're basement dwellers but you're a border hopper
you look like the kid that would get an unbelievably low score on the pacer test.
you're the guy that wears rash guards at swimming pools because he's insecure about his body
You're to most effeminate Mexican I've ever seen.
Give this guy and snap back and tell him to start a NWA tribute band
you forgot to wipe away that last guy's shit properly, you still have a little smudge on your cheek.
You look like a Milk Duds edition of Mr. Potato Head
Call him whack-a-mole.
