Yo, you on the left lookin like John Rhys Davies from Raiders of the Lost Ark http://imgur.com/0Xy0kvl 
On the right: I bet your favorite hobby is guilting all of the older congregation members into tithing their life savings.   On the left: You're like a fat, brown Guy Fawkes who hasn't showered in weeks.
You fucking plebs, you both look like you eat the ass like groceries but with each other
Left: You look thirty, so it might be time to take off your high school senior ring and start working a real job. Right: Affliction-style tees are made for douchebags with attitude, not scrotum-chinned runts.
They say opposites attract, but in this instant they are much more than a passing attraction, they are life couple.
Token Arab #1 looks like a hairy six year old. Whitey looks like the gay guy who shits on your dick and leaves without a tip.
