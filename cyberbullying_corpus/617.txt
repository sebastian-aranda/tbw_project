Your dad wouldnt do anything for you.  Hes disappointed enough as it is
Straight guy?  Like Santa is real. I'd have his pants down within a minute or two. No doubt.

All this says is anal. 
Of course my dad would lose in a two on one...
He looks like a blew a guy in the JC Penney dressing room to get the employee discount on those pants.
