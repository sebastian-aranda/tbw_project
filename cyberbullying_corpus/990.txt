esports don't count
Competitive eating not a sport
I'm guessing you're the ball....
Noah!  Assume the position!  https://31.media.tumblr.com/10fe4d6756a4ae180141603348737cc6/tumblr_ngiwhmIz391u5fceno1_r1_250.gif
You are so unathletic you fake retardation to get in special olympics to feel good about yourself 
Judging by your size, no you don't.
By the looks of it your family tree must be a circle.
Passing out towels in the showers, offering to give tushy rubs, and  picking up dirty underwear is not really a sport, it is a profession. 
Sports?  If table muscle is the rag, you should be working at Walmart. The only sports Noah plays with with himself and his boyfriends.
you look like a the father of a child you never wanted. 
Your mouth might say "sports" but your double-chin can't lie.
The yellow ribbon winner at the special Olympics. Look how excited he is. 
Mascots are not athletes.
Rest of the crowd: Hi Noah.
