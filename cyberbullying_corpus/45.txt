You don't belong at Hogwarts you fucking muggle.
You look like the snitch in Dead Poet Society
I bet your parents heard the worst when they were told that they're having you
I imagine you looking in the mirror and saying this to yourself every morning as you try to unmangle that dumb hair.
You look like one of those background kids at Hogwarts that wasn't un-average enough to make it into the cool houses.
Typical british kid... *too uptight to use paper*

Did i very rick rolled
Im only going to say nice things so  I don't get shot next time I go near  your school... so uh nice hair...
You look like Lurch's short ugly cousin. The difference between you two is he shouldn't be dead.
I saw you on the side of a Milk carton. Your family doesnt want you back.
