You look like you could be Chris Pratt's ugly brother
you probably get rejected by whoever is on the other side of that glory hole. 
Did your mom do your hair? or does she just buy your clothes?
You look like a low budget fat Jamie Lannister
Captain of the glory hole!   Sail on, brave sailor! 
You look like you wear slide sandals with uncut toenails that hang over the edge. To make things worse, you're also probably the guy plays the acoustic guitar at parties, starving for the attention your dad never gives you for being a music major.
Looks like you just got done crying, did your dad tell you he wishes you were your brother again?
I actually recognize you. I loved your work as "fat kid #1" in ever movie ever made.
I'm assuming the cat liter is for when your mistress calls you on Skype and orders you to shit in a cat box and drink a saucer of milk.
I get the feeling every night, you cut off more of your hair in secret to glue on to your face. 
Guys like you are the reason I shave daily. 
Hard to lower anything that will be useless to you anyway.
If you cleaned yourself up a bit I know you could at least have a few friends.
