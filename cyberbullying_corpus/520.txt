You look like the potato Matt Damon grew out of his shit in The Martian.
Your a zit factory too
I guess you could feel good that you're still alive, but you shouldn't be that young and look like you've gone 5 rounds with Cain Velasquez.
I see you set a goal of 440.  How many dicks do you still have left to suck?
&gt;ive been feeling pretty good lately  why?
You look like you use "Irish descent" as a scapegoat on why you are an alcoholic. 
Playing with yourself 6 times a day is actually what you mean by "feeling pretty good lately"
You look like what Mark Wahlberg would have looked like if he spent 3 years in San Quinton.
Have you been feeling good because you murdered a record number of neighbourhood pets? 
For just 30 cents a day, you too can help this man with his conjoined twin myslexia.  That's a zit?    You're fucking lying.
Are those scars from acne or from your mom jabbing you with a coat hanger?
How long have you been a registered sex offender?
You look like you took up smoking before puberty.
If you're feeling good, that must mean the antidepressants are working. 
Your zits are the most symmetrical part of your face.
