How uneven can one person's face be?
Even your stomach is frowning. 
Did she leave you because your eyes kept wandering?
Shit you're out of shape! A few push ups wouldn't kill you
Maybe she was allergic to the caterpillars on your forehead
It doesn't count as a yes if they're catatonic.
So he dumped you? After he dumped in you?
You manage to look like the kind of mentally retarded guy who cant even get sympathy. 
You look like you wear a tapout shirt to intimidate freshman clubbers.
Mr. Bean moved to the Jersey Shore?
Looking at your hairline, I can imagine exactly what you're going to look like bald and with another 50 pounds. Almost like some Costanza-type character. She had the right idea leaving you.
If the Despicable Me guy was from Newark.
Did she leave because of your perv stubble?
Next time make the piece of paper at least three times larger if you're not gonna have a shirt on. 
With a face like yours hopefully you have a big dick, or a lot of money. Oh wait, you said ex fianc. Don't worry, you'll meet another muscle daddy will come along someday.
