Oh nice! Your parents finally took the helmet off. Bet they still think it's their fault for having you immunized as a baby.
it looks like every one of your facial features is pointing in a different direction
I loved you in 'Rookie of the Year!'  Cubs still suck though.
You should get your life straight but most importantly, you should get your head straight first.
Did you use Photoshop to expand the top right part of your face?
"Feed me, Seymour!"
"You look like a filthy, woman hating, spraytanned, bread-tossing, shallow, brainless, Italian waste of space douchebag" - Your roast in 5 years.
You look like Tom Hanks if he went through the face pulling game in Mario Party.

Just keep swimming, just keep swimming...
looks like you stuff you head up your dads ass. 
Alright so first lets start with the fact that your head appears to be at an angle, it kinda looks like your mother punched the shit out of you as a baby and your skull is still recovering. You have the lips of a botox injected 40 year old trophy wife, and your eyebrows could hide an army. Also I have no idea how you managed to fuck up the /r/rateme in your picture, seriously that is a feat of stupidity, either you wrote it backwards then took a picture or you took a picture in a mirror at a weird angle for some reason. Either way I'm sure your family will be very proud of your future career managing a Denny's so best wishes and remember when I say I want my eggs over easy I god damn mean it.   BOOM roasted
