Listen Stan, I hope this reaches you in time,  I was gonna roast you, but I wanted to do it in rhyme.  Your hairs wavey, but not the 420 kind,   It's what I'd expect to see on a horses behind.   Listen Stan, the smile you got on your face is forced,  Your eyes tell the story, lost your kids, divorced,  Now I don't wanna make you go and off yourself,  But remember life's always better when you fall down a well.   Listen Stan, I don't wanna see you drown,  I don't wanna hear tapes of your final sounds.  Your life's only gonna get worse, you can't change it,  Your life's like your face, I can rearrange it.  Stan I beg you, don't let me down,  One knife can turn your smile into a frown.  EDIT:  Thanks for the gold homie,  Upvotes alone showed me,  That people liked what they saw,  But I can tell you liked it more.  Imma melt down the gold and use it as a grill for my teeth,  So I can scream 2Chainz when I lay my next victim down in defeat. 
You look like you're second guessing your decision to come out of the closet.
Bitch you need more than a haircut.  
Your eyebrows look like burned french fries.
...And that's the last we heard from the real skin shady
deer in the headlights or meth in the deadlights?
I'd hit it
damn you look like someone is pointing a gun at you  bonus roast: that shoulder is missing a bone
You look like the love child of Turtle and E.
You look like the face of AIDS 
You look like you're shell shocked from too much COD
Looks like you shaved half your arm and stuck it to your bushy brows
While my kids went to college and now making mid 6 figures, we need idiots to join the military....  Alas, Peoples Exhibit #1 is THe Real Shady----now unemployed, PTSD and Don't Tell---
