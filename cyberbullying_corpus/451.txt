I'd normally say you should never degrade yourself for female attention, but with you, might be the only way.
Amusement huh.. Bet you don't give her that in bed 
Does the 'her' howl at the moon? Or does the 'her' have a double chin like you do....
You look like the kind of guy who'd willingly humiliate himself online in hopes of getting some pity sex.
You look like you just killed an entire family of bambies
Did you get in some freak accident and had your arms replaced with that of a chimp?
Is this what it takes to amuse a body pillow nowadays?
What the friend zone looks like at 32.
You tell all your friends that 'she's basically my girlfriend' while she tells all her friends 'he's basically my gay best friend' and I'm willing to bet that this is just another thing on the long list of degrading things you've done for her hoping that she's finally going to realize you're the 'nice guy' she's always talking about waiting for.   You're not. She doesn't even see you as a man. 
Might wanna try writing that R again, mate.
I'll bet you masterbate all slow and fat. 
Your mom reads r/roastme?  Well she knows now that you suck cock.
You brush your teeth with country crock?
