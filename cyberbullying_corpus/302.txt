Left to right:   "Mr Serious", he tries to look serious but at best he looks fucking awkward.  "Mr Coconut" whose nickname is an insult to coconuts since they have something inside their hollow interiors.  "Gavin the wanker", he jacked it off in every room the school has to offer.  "Porkins", the sci-fi nerd. He shouldn't even bother trying to look good in pictures, cameras can't get an angle on a surface that fucking round.
"I am called Ham, because I enjoy ham radio. This is Email, Cosine, Report Card, Database, and Lisa. Your nickname will be Cosmos."
