You've certainly showed us yours.
I see a washer, a dryer, and a refrigerator 
You have all the hallmarks of a future binge-eater.
Even the washer and dryer don't want to pleasure you. 
All this pic is missing is a black dude. 
Those silver nails might be the wildest thing you've ever done.
Accidentally zoomed in on your picture. I'll post another comment once I've been and showered my mind...
You have "Practice Girl" written all over you
you would be cute if you had a different head, face and hair  does the washer cry when you put it on spin and sit on it?  the t1000 called. he wants his nails back
I could flick your toe and your neck would jiggle
Show you my worst? You're looking at her
