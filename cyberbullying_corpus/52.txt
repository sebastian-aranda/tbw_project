Saw the word "cancer" and thought, I'm not touching that, something the virgin's heard all his life.
I don't care to guess who's who, but what I can say is that you look like you'll both be involuntarily cuckolded at least once in your lives.
Guy on the left looks like he might have accomplished something, even if it was only a perfect attendance award in kindergarten. The person on the right looks like they're struggling with their gender identity. Those are my bets.

My money says that the cancer survivor is on the left, because he looks like he has achieved something in life. But god damn, the dude on the right, I mean "hopeless" was the understatement of a lifetime. 
I don't believe the cancer survivor but... No doctor would let either of these guys live... The virgin bit I assumed
The virgin should fuck the cancer out of that giant cancer ear... Problem solved.
So one is de-nutted, the other can't get it up 
When they hold their basketball shorts like that, you can always tell that they know they have a tiny dick and are trying to hide the chode stubble.  As for the cancer kid, I guess there's only two ways radiation can fuck with you: Either you get super powers or your face melts. I see that your ears are the first thing that's dropping off your head.
Ewwww...  bitch on the right can't keep his shorts on. Meaning, nothing in the back and nothing up front.    The other bitch either got them snipped or they are still stuck up inside
Tsss i wus gunna get maryed one time, but i coodnt cus she was sick with canser :( i fuken cryed a hundrid teers
I knew who the virgin was when I saw the Visual Studio t-shirt.
You're not a virgin, life already fucked you. 
You both look sick.  So who is the husband 
Could go either way.
