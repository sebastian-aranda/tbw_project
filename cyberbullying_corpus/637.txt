Mutilated*
you look like the type of "musician" who can play the shit out of some sheet music but can't create original shit to save his life. no matter how many scales you run and phrases you memorize, you'll always live a "2nd chair life". 
I bet that's not the only thing you blow on. 
thank mr skeletal. doot doot.
Band Geeks--Band Camp---Coach Sandusky---Boylove.
Thank god you're in band, otherwise you wouldn't have ANY kind of tone.
You look like some dude who will blow for food
Only the coolest kids at school get leather cases for only a certain portion of their trumpet.
Looks like you play the skin flute too
Blowing and holding a paper to yourself doesn't make you multitalented, it makes you just as talented as anyone with a runny nose.
This is the same picture on your dating profile. Given that you have the posture of an earthworm, you asked yourself "how can I make myself look more appealing?" and for some fucked up reason the answer was "Brass instrument!"
That's not the only thing you like blowing.
