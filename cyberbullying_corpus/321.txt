Is the twin towers the name of a pancake special?
I'd be surprised if you could squeeze that fat ass head into the cockpit 
I can smell your body odor through the internet
Can't even suicide bomb right...
Did your Kumar ass hit the towers while trying to park in a White Castle parking lot?
9/11 more like 7/11, ur face alone could destroy both buildings
The only flights you catch are the ones who offer a free meal. 
Twin towers? Is that the IT company you work at?
You look like you've been destroying tacos rather than towers. 
Kumar took too many trips To White Castle 
the only thing u could penetrate is ur boyfriends ass
Only after you get the lawns mowed and pick the crops out back 
I take it you have a camera on the top of your shoes, and you are seen in the girls bathroom A LOT!

What fly a plane? I don't think you could drive a Buick.
You look all pleased with yourself, as if you're some stud because you can fuck any goat you want. 
Wearing an apple earphones doesn't make you look kiddo.
I can smell the social anxiety. Highschool freshman repeatedly using race jokes to get some laughs from the cools kids then turning to reddit in order to show your 2 friends how funny and brave  you are online
