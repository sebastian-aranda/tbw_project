Teeth are more crooked than Watergate and Benghazi's lovechild
You are the girl that pretty girls keep around as friends... Hint. You are the ugly one.

You are the least attractive of all of your friends. 
You look like the only reason you're doing this is because the girls at the back said so and you don't wanna stop pretending they're your friends even though you know they just laugh at how ugly you are.
The rule is to surround yourself with girls who are uglier than you to make you seem prettier. You nailed finding an ugly bunch but they sure as hell aren't doing you any favors.
You're peaking looks-wise, and the fall from grace isn't even that far
