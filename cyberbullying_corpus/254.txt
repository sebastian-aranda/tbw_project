Macklemore has you on his mirror to remind himself of what could have happened.
You look like you are swole in the streets, power bottom in the sheets. 
You must have really pissed off the person who does your hair.
Rather ride you.
How is your younger sister, Blossom, anyway?
You look like Bobby Flay with fetal alcohol syndrome and a severe vitamin D deficiency.
