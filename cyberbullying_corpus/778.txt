You look like you ride the elevator to try and make friends.
When guys get asked if you were hot or not when they meet you, they say, "Eh, shes got a great personality". 
You have the forehead of a 65 year old man. 
You look like you really like reading and knitting things that are supposed to be scarves.
It looks like your forehead is trying to run away from the rest of your face
Your favorite lipstick color is dick. 
You write titles as terribly as you do your make up  
If ever there was a need for bangs, you forehead is it. 
If I were going bald too, I'd just shave it all off. 
How many crayons did you get through before you got your eyebrows right?
you are balding very badly.
why the long face?
The length of that chin, nose and forehead together is surely enough to land a light aircarft
all your boyfriends wanted you from behind, huh?
How soon after I fuck you in a drunken stupor will you start killing my pets and planning our wedding?
I've seen better post-op pics.
Your Head looks like the number 8.
You look like a balding transsexual without make up
Your ex boyfriend has just as much chance of coming back to you as your hairline
Phony, fake, forced smile that cannot conceal the utter self-loathing contained within. Dead, hollow eyes, void of any emotion. Massive, gargantuan and woefully misshapen head topped off with receding hairline. Soft, loose abdominal region, no doubt harboring a mannish spare tire. Bloated fingers. And you expect us to focus on your lipstick color-? Sister, you have bigger fish to fry, trust me on that.
Trying eating some of the gallons of concealer you use for that acne, so you can cover up the overly eccentric personality.
