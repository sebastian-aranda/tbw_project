Those girls behind you are laughing at what a flake you are. 
You are like a fly-over state for white folk
You look like a drugged up version of Hank green
Look at all of the girls behind you, not even aware of your existence
You're a nerdier Ben Wyatt. I bet you're terrible at The Cones of Dunshire
I guess since that table of girls won't notice you, we have to right?
"Sanctuary! Saaanctuary!" 
I bet you're so lonely you have your stack of books from your mediocre arts degree to put the camera on to take the picture.
your mom should've roasted you when she still had a choice.
You look a little young for a toupee
you look like the blonde from zombie land who got laid for the first time 
You look like Adam Scott with an extra chromosone.
I can hear the Black Keys and smell of weed coming from your room
After two years, the all girl school still doesn't know that you were actually born a boy.
