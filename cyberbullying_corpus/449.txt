Zoolander: the awkward years
Just judging by your handwriting, you should be smashed in the face with heavy mining equipment. 
You have more herpes than Lindsay Lohan
Your face makes better 'r's than your hands do.
Looks like puberty already did.
Sorry dude there wasn't a vaccine for fugly when you were conceived.  
I don't think I could possibly do any worse than what your parents did when they created you tbh
Your farts smell like turnips
Each freckle represents a dude mounting your ass in the future
Looks like you tried shaving your unibrow in hopes to glue some of that hair onto your balls.  puberty will be over soon.
Ugly, but stupid.
Did you get some plan splatter cooking some tomatoes? 
Your face looks like it was used as a shield in a hurricane

Boy. If you don't get your caterpillar head ass eyebrows off your face. You got more volcanos on your face then the world even has active. Crater head ass boy face look like a potato. Herpes all over them lips boy look like mother fuckin flappy pussy lips. Crimson chin head ass boy your face look like a fuckin bean 
How's your eye feeling? Pink eye is a bitch! 
Just swallow next time like the uncomfortable mess you are. That eye is gonna sting for a while.
