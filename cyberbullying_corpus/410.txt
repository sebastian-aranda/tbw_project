You maintained baby fat and baby teeth
It looks like your teeth are heading the same direction as all those dicks you suck, to the back of your throat.
A face that needs a beard.
On the positive side, I'm pretty sure with the right weather conditions and a little luck I could land a Boeing 747 on your forehead
If your mouth was any smaller you might not be able to eat big boy foods
"I used to skate."
He lost his first Tooth last week
oh, look. It's the "I'm 32 but want to be 20 again so I got my septum pierced" guy.
Don't catch that nose ring when you're fro-picking your beard.
You're mid 30s and you still wear Vans and dark clothing to look cool while you get your GED.
Looks like you've already taken a few jabs to your teeth. And nose. And eyes. And just, y'know, your life in general.
Eyebrows not on fleek 
Aaaaah, No! Not the teeth! everyone ever
You literally look like a pig. You look exactly like a little barnyard piggy at a petting zoo.
No way dude you're actually very good looking and let's date. I'll buy you dinner before drugging you and leaving you to drown in the river. No one loves you. No one will miss you. The police won't bother. You would be the perfect crime. 
Couldn't you blow your nose before taking the picture you disgusting pig? They are two boggers coming out of it, waiting to join the crusts of your miserable love life that got caught in that gruesome, repulsive beard of yours.
Sigh, not even his nose ring is straight.
Looking at you makes MY teeth hurt. 
It looks like someone spilled a box of chicklets in a bird's nest.  
WTF is this thing hanging from your nose?  You escape the zoo? And that beard.  You ever deflea that mess? **What the hell do you have in your pants?*  A hard buttplug?  It's 5;05, the retard bus will be pulling up shortly, so get your shit together
