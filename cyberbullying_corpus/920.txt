Poor man's Chris Hemsworth.
Spent all that money on that ugly ring, when all you needed was a comb.
You have feelings? Well, don't bottle them up. They'll just stick in your head and create dangerous pressure! Then you'll end up with a massively disproportionate pumpkin head...
You support PETA in hopes you finally get rights
And I take it that your loving waifu has strong feelings for you too?
bet you're a juggalo 
Damn he's bringing back the Kate Gosselin hairstyle 
Did your arm get tangled in the umbilical cord while you were in the womb and stop growing?
When you're selling used cars in a few years after dropping out of college, those beady eyes will really come into their own.
How long were you able stay on the field hockey team before everyone realized you weren't a fat lesbian?   Your head is bloated like a cadaver that's been fished out of a river.  When you go to the barber do you ask him for the "basement dweller"?  You look like the moon.
you have feelings but no personal hygiene
Take a fucking shower your hair is greaser then a McDonald's bigmac
Really cool school ring, did you buy that just to show you finished 5th grade?
More like you HAD feelings. It looks like you ate them. 
you've got feelings and I'm about to hurt all of them. your hair looks like you used your boyfriends cum as gel and didn't get it in the right spot but you weren't about to take a shower, what the fuck is going on with that skin looks like you're a leper, I've seen god do some shit  work but he really fucked  your eyes bud.
This is my first roast and I don't know what to do. But I'm guessing I have to insult you? I don't like your handwriting you bitch!
 I want to see more horrid shit people have to say about my appearance! Bring it on, ya'll!
