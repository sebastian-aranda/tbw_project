I mean weren't you roasted you'r whole life dude a deep V neck a cd / sandpaper mix on your wall? and a nose of a pig man how related to a roast can you get
You are that one smug hipster shit that lives in San Diego.
atleast you wont have that red hair for long, and if you havent come out of the closet yet they all know anyways
You didn't get enough attention on the first post, so you had to make a second you attention whore. That's the true reason you have a "YouTube" channel. 
The 'm' in 'roast me' dripping sadly like the single tear shed from a YouTuber's eye when they're all outta likes and ideas
You look like the alien in mib the split second before his face pops open.
You're that one guy friend that hot chicks have because they know they don't have to worry about you coming on to them.
