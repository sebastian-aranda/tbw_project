I've never seen a regrettable person on a tattoo before.
He seems like one of those guys everyone assumes to be bad ass, but actually takes it up the ass. 
Goatee *and* a knee tattoo? I got news for you pal: your brother is also your brother-in-law because he looks like the kind of guy who fucks his sister.
He looks like he knows a thing or two about white supremacy.
You should probably talk him out of thinking he's a traffic cone.
You look like someone who ownes a white van and a surprising amount of candy
Your tattoos like you bought them in the kids' section at Target
Does that leg tattoo protect his virginity?
He's the first one on roastme that i chuckled at. What has he got to be confident about?
Especially in your grammar.
oh, you're just jealous that he has bigger tits than you.
Your plan to distract us from your combover with ugly tats and sleeveless tees is not working at all. 
Cool tattoo bro  Edit: Not!
You look like a hillbilly who is trying to fit in. And its not working
You look like you go to ICP concerts
His beard reminds me of my pubes 
Fat Peckerwood. Wondering if the rebel yell goes with flushing the toilet sounds at the trailer park.
I bet you like your house you probably bought it for 50 cents 
Your body says "fearsome" but your face says "i was raped as a child"
You pimp out your fam on roastme, im sorry your life sucks so much
