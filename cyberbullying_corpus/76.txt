You look like you're about to open that window and "go for it."
It's sad the plant you are standing next to has more personality than you.
Your jaw is bigger than your head. No wonder you thought this was a good idea.
Do you need a kickstand for your head?
Your legs look like bowling pins, your body probably smells like curry and your head looks like the top was curb stomped. 
This guy has obviously posed for too many mug shots with that stance. Arrested on multiple counts of turd burgling.
You make a lovely couple.
