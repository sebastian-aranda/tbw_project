The only thing that is struggling more than her social anxiety is her left eyebrow growing in properly
she just looks so fucking boring. if she were prettier or uglier, she'd at least be slightly interesting. she's the human version of room temperature tap water. if she were a word, she'd be "oh."

Sign held up to conveniently cover the Adam's apple.
Her fivehead goes all the down to the tip of her nose , just saying !!
You look like a hood rat hoe on shameless.
