You remind me of myself as a fetus.
"Jimmy?"  "YEAH MOM"  "Have you seen my spectacles?"  "N-NO MOM of course not"
You don't deserve the attention. 
You probably shoot lots of guns at the range and make witty comments on facebook, but really your just lame as fuck cuz you used to be really fat, and now your just kind of fat.
Every picture if yourself is a selfie, isn't it?
