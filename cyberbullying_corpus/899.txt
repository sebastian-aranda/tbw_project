Because the girls were sensitive to your needs and knew that you really just wanted to go with each other.
You look like you enjoy the smell of each others after-gym dicks. Girls have a way of telling this. 
Maybe it's because you're ugly
No one wants to go to homecoming with potential terrorists.
Lefty looks like had a stroke, and is trying to cover it up by looking tough, but ends up looking like he had a stroke *and* his glasses aren't strong enough anymore.  Guy on the right looks like the laxatives just kicked in.  If this is how you both look on a daily basis, I bet those girls laughed when you asked them.
So you are going as a bonded couple instead.  40 lashes and the slave market for both of you.
Both of you will ALWAYS be rejected by girls. You two might want to save your welfare checks---chip in on an old hooker. The only woman you will ever get will be an old AIDS infected street walker,

Give up trying to date women, you two were meant for each other.
