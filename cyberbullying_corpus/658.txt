Your body is 75% neck. 
If only they sold transitions for your  face.
You're the guy who stands outside the circle of people talking, and doesnt say a word. But it's okay, some guy gave you a nod one day, so you think you're 'in'. 
This is literally what people think of when they hear the word *nerd*
You have the 3rd most lovable face in that room. The guy behind you and the drawing on the wall of what I can only assume to be a Garbage Pail Kid attract more women than you ever will while you are too busy chasing a dead end dream to be a star D1 basketball player. But don't worry because the tears that run past the ears on your mile long neck will be covered by those sweet Oakley transitions.
I was 95% sure you were bound to a wheelchair before I made my way down that skyscraper neck to find out your just malnourished. 
You look like Ed Helms had an abortion
You must be the coolest kid in the Chess club
Do the new hormones help with the transition too?
17 and they already got your portrait on the wall huh?
You look like Joe Buck had relations with a pair of pleated khakis.
The future Jim Harbaugh of US Men's Water Polo. 
And you got one nut, a small sack and a dick that a parakeet would be embarrassed with
I honestly thought you were paraplegic from those legs  
Your pants give off that "every nerd in a 90's movie ever" look
Did no one ever tell you not to wear white after Labor Day, you uncivilized prick?
