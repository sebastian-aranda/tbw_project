Oh good you remembered to clear off the dildos from your dresser before snapping this pic 
is your halloween costume mediocrity?
Your nose ring makes you unique the way kids in my high school died their hair black just to be different.   There is nothing special about you. 
You're the girl who wears hoodies all the time so people don't know how fat you really are, right?
"I'm not like other girls, I wear hoodies in my selfies."
Next time ask your parents to pay the heating bill.
Wonder what that hoodie is hiding
Was your Facebook post that was meant to lure people in to tell you you're pretty not enough attention for you?
Halloween was saturday
Mr skeltal? Is that you?
I'm just sad you can't zip up that hood all the way
I thought ET went home.
obvious daddy issues 
Keep wearing your hoodie, hopefully you'll get confused for another Trayvon Martin
you look kinda fat but like you used to be skinny but really let yourself go after a breakup or something
bugs bunny called, he wants his teeth back
Cute you dressed the pig up like a person for halloween
Do you always look like a malicious goblin or was this just for Halloween?
"Hey look I wear hoodies i'm cool." Psych you probably don't talk much but somehow get invited to parties and give a minimum two blowjobs per party. And your feet probably stink, just got a feeling.
your nose ring screams you make great life choices
You look like the kid from hard candy. But nobody wants to rape you.
My favorite part is when you put your hood up, that way we don't have to see your face. 
Looks like you managed to wash the blood stains out of your boyfriends hoodie and I'm gonna bet you drank his Arizona Ice Tea and ate his Skittles too.
For the flat-chested gal, a baggy hoodie is much more economical than a padded bra.
When god giveth, he just kept on giving with you. Big nose, teeth and eyes, got the trifecta.
