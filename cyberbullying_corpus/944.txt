You have the same sad, hopeless look in your eyes that your dad has when he looks at you
the face of depression.
cuz u look like a brute from Halo 3
U already look roasted from the shitty weed u got from your friends dad
Hey man, no need to cry. These are all jokes.
Hey look everyone Igor the exchange student from Chernobyl is getting in on the roasting fun.
Your eyes look so glazed that the cops might try to eat you. 
This guy walks in the bar and the bartender says "Why the long face"? and this guy replies "because I am a love child of a horse and a grumpy cat"
You have that dreamy look that says  "be my first, I'll pay for the motel room".
