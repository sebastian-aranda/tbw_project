TRIGGERED
Did it hurt when your hair got stuck in the cotton candy machine?
I can't do this. There's just too much here.
*  You need feminism because you're angry no man in his right mind would ever interact with you.  * You get triggered so often that if you were a gun you'd be a fucking [Metal Storm^TM.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8hlj4EbdsE)  * You dye your hair that shade of green to show just how fucking toxic you are to the human environment.  
So when [they cut your kid out of you](https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/3g0ize/it_happens_today/), did it see you and sign itself up for adoption or did your parents make you toss it out because it had a better chance at life as a dumpster baby than with you?
Drew Careys daughter going through her too cool for school phase. 
Its like Bulma gave up on life
Considering the 'unique' hair color and the 'my cousin is finally certified' piercings, this roast would be absolutely *brutal* if only you were interesting to look at.
I bet the work experience section of your resume is totally stacked.
Did you think dying your hair that awful color would distract people from looking at your disgusting face?
Ouija board, shitty tattoos, bad piercings, atrocious hair cut, poor eyesight, and terrible genes..... Haven't you been roasted enough?
I have seen more appealing things on the bottom of my shoes
All the edginess in the world won't hide the fact that you look like a fat 40 year old soccer mom.

The guy who pierced your lip could have done mankind a favor and included your top lip too. Would have shut you up AND saved some food for the rest of us
You crave attention so much you need us to call you ugly and sad, because no one wants to spend the time it takes with you in real life 
Never knew a pincushion could be this ugly. 
No wonder so many guys prefer guys now.
Clearly you seek attention because no man will touch you
How much disappointment can your parents handle before they die?
Nothing is going to hide that plain Jane F-ugly you got , so why not just triple down on even more failed DIY B.S. , like , just buy a full facial mask and call it a life !! 
Ok ok lemme guess. Staying at "dads" until your career with the whole gender studies things picks up?
You are the Reverse-Viagra.
Not a roast but nice hair

I bet you like to be choked to remind yourself of your non-existent father.
The amount of people that think this picture screams "my daddy doesn't love me" should be roast enough.
You look like you're doing everything you can to make your daddy's dick go soft.
