My grandpa already roasted enough of you back in '39
you look like anne franks gay cousin
Did you get your parent's permission before getting on the internet? 
thank mr skeltal
We can tell you have a foreskin. Stop it. You are embarrassing all the other jewboys 
Where do you live? Rabbi Robert's Erev? 
You could hit on a nazi with a tattoo gun and still not get a number.
"They hate us 'cause they ain't us." More like: "We hate you because you're a Jew."
He already looks like my next podiatrist/accountant
I had no idea the kabalists created golemns from discarded foreskins until now.
i bet your house smells like the same fucking spices every time.
No surprises that you're cheap but using your dead grandfather's clothes is a step too far..
You dress like Mr Rogers. Only difference is, if you asked me to be your neighbour, I'd be sure to get right the fuck outta there.
