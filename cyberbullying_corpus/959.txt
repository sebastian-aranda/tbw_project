Looking at you makes my eyes insecure about what they have just seen.
You look like a transvestite version of lieutenant Dan
Your future looks like a lot of meth-related face scars and 20 years of hostessing at Texas Roadhouse. 
Meh
The way you hold that paper makes people with cerebral palsy look good
Jesus, could you have held that sign up in a more uncomfortable fashion? You'll have to try harder when you eventually apply to be a ring-girl.
Congratulations on your job as a legging stress tester
All those guys who've left you over the past few years? Yeah,it's because of your resting bitch-face.
The only way a guy will come near your heart is by ejaculating on that plywood board of a chest that you are hiding behind that paper.  
You look like Mrs Potatohead, with Down's syndrome.
Confirmed.
You got a fupa which tells me you don't like your home life, so you eat your feelings. It's not a daddy issue; if it were you'd be a lot more slutty. Don't worry, though. Every mental note you take about your mom's shitty parenting you can put into action after you get pregnant at the Homecoming dance. Again, don't worry. Your mom will help you take care of the baby while you go to community college because, you know... she knows *exactly* how you're feeling.
Is that the same pose you do after your teacher asks you a question and before you respond with "duuuuuuuuuh, I dunno..."?
Looks like you have a few extra chromosomes to give to the needy. 
You probably smell like stale cigarettes and 2-day-old semen. 
I swear I saw you selling pussy in a trailer park.
I'd do it
the pink doesn't begin to cover the skank, or your bulimia
