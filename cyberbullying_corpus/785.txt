Holy shit. Is there a minimum forehead size you have to clear to moderate /r/roastme ?
Damn all these mods kind of reminds me of the Goonies.   If all of them was just Chunk.  And missing a chromosome. 
aresniccrazy: What are you going to do when your eyebrows start forming a cocoon?  Draculix: The way real-estate prices are going, you could probably start leasing out your fore-head.  enzo32ferrari: Next time someone dares you to stick your face in a giant strawberry mold for a day, just say no.  Fungax: The sign is the only thing as backwards as your taste in glasses.  OnThe_Pursuit: Perhaps you could take a page from the Stig, and never show your face again?  RoyalLlama: Repeat after me: Semen is not a haircare product.  SIipB: The walls are pink, but still your nose is the most dominant feature in that photo  SimplifyEUW: Too much face, not enough beanie.  tamallamaluv: Modernist Designers would be impressed by the amount of blank-space incorporated into your face.  touchandagree: I always wondered what happened to the actor who played Gollum.  EDIT: Spacing was all wrong!
All right you stale twenty piece box of fuck-nuggets. I'm a bit late to the party, but lets see what I can't do.  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;   /u/aresniccrazy: Your eyebrows were the first affordable awning.   /u/Draculix: For all your aviation and flight experience you'll never be able to reach the altitude your hairline is headed for.   /u/enzo32ferrari: In the widespread Indonesian fires there are currently more than enough lady-bois being roasted.    /u/Fungax: You likely have less fashion sense and Reddit Karma combined than you have dick-hairs that aren't ingrown.   /u/OnThe_Pursuit: At first I thought you looked charming. &lt;3 Then I realized any charms *you* had would be used for **fucking [Summoning Pouches](http://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Summoning_pouches)**  /u/RoyalLlama: I can't tell if those are your fingers, or leftover Oktoberfest sausages. Who am I kidding? You don't leave leftovers.   /u/SIipB: I didn't know Criss angel used Reddit? I guess you're just another Jesus of Suburbia, Huh?   /u/SimplifyEUW: Just like [SoloMid](http://lol.gamepedia.com/Team_SoloMid), you (and your roasts) have been nothing but garbage since April.   /u/tamallamaluv: You use your ethnicity to hide behind Japanese culture (despite being Chinese) because you have the personality of a wet breeze-block. Congrats on being able to pass on that award winning personality to two children now.  /u/touchandagree: Chris Colfer with his first "vaginal pube hair" goatee.  &amp;nbsp; Edit 1: Spacing.
You have to be at least 13 to post. ^^^unless ^^^you're ^^^a ^^^mod.  Arseniccrazy: It's like Eddie Kaye Thomas was born with fetal alcohol syndrome. We were all hoping for SIDS.  Draculix: So do you spend so much time on Space Engineers because your dreams of actually getting into space where dismissed after you realized that they didn't make peanut shaped astronaut helmets?  enzo32ferrari: Hey glad you're back over with us on r/hookah, can't wait to have the mod of r/hookahtrade ask us retarded questions like he's never made a bowl before. Maybe you'll start asking people here how to insult.  Fungax: Can tell that you're the one that literally does nothing as a mod and is only listed because you send dick pics to SlipB.  OnThe_Pursuit: **Checks top comments profile...I see that people enjoy your comments about as much as they enjoy looking at you.  RoyalLlama: Trigger warning! Also sends "dick" pics to SlipB in full fur costume... still bigger than Fungax though...  SlipB: Despite the dick pics, still manages to get shit done... like keeping his room looking as if an 11 year old girl from the 90's had her way with it.  SimplifyEUW: You look like the generic white kid that follows a group of friends around school all day, but if we asked them who you were, nobody would even realize you follow them. Also, you're a wood 3 teemo player that spams "get cancer" to the enemy team when you die to jungle creeps.  tamallamaluv: Well, on the bright side of life, China getting rid of the one child policy means your parents don't have to be so depressed about you managing to slither back to their doorstep after they tossed your cross-eyed ass out. The weird part is that they thought the famiry name would end with you if you had a kid, like the father would stick around to claim it or something.  touchandagree: If you can't grow a beard, don't try. It just looks like a landing strip for the dicks on your chin.  
/u/Draculix, you look like you wore a blindfold too tight, for too long, and it permanently squeezed in the middle of your face.
Colectively, you guys should get a TON of dick.  Edit: Excluding tamallamaluv though.
/u/SimplifyEUW you might be Diamond 4 in Solo Queue but you'r Bronze 2 in the mirror, we all know which sibling got the better looks
Jesus christ, you're all 'tweens.  edit:  ----  /u/arseniccrazy : Supervirgin.  /u/Draculix :  Please tell me you photoshopped your forehead that large, otherwise I feel bad for your future children.  /u/enzo32ferrari : Hoping the backwards gif would distract people from your fivehead failed.  /u/Fungax : You look like the product of a douchebag on hipster rape.  /u/OnThe_Pursuit : They do not let twelve year olds drive cars, you're not and will never be the stig.  /u/RoyalLlama : Second guessing my assessment of 'tweens here, this might a 38 year old lesbian.  /u/SIipB : Why does this girl have chin pubes and a molestache?  /u/SimplifyEUW : Supervirgin's sidekick Betaboy.  /u/tamallamaluv : Epicanthic folds gone wild.  /u/touchandagree : Ahh, the native American style beard. Apachee here, apachee there...
aresniccrazy:http://cdn23.us1.fansshare.com/photos/eugenelevy/bguzndzcyaa-tbh-large-eyebrows-1624180443.jpg  Draculix: Looks like Macaulay Culkin's rehab failed  enzo32ferrari: Hard to roast someone of both genders  Fungax: Thanks. Needed new material for /r/hittablefaces  OnThe_Pursuit: Bro, you look like a practice tool for gay men.   RoyalLlama: The only thing you wanted roasted is a side of twinkies and lard  SIipB: You look like Justin Beiber fucked a copy of Legend of Zelda  SimplifyEUW: The minimum posting age is 13, jackass  tamallamaluv: Such an honor to have the last atomic bomb survivor on this subreddit  touchandagree: Literally most basic bitch of the bunch
Look at all of you, brought together here because of one love: Verbal abuse.  Which clearly runs in each of your families. If I was your father I would make it my life's goal to get you to kill yourself and fix my greatest mistake: you.
/u/SlipB you're what Paris Hilton would look like if she also spent a day being gang banged at the beach.
Can /u/SIipB look any more gay? [Yes he can](http://media.giphy.com/media/oegzbOpJS7MqI/giphy.gif)
"/u/touchandagree is  Christian Slater's unclaimed kid."  #["...*LEAVE /u/SIipB ALONNEE!*"](https://youtu.be/WqSTXuJeTks?t=3m3s)  
OnThe_Pursuit is like that one friend who insists he knows how to "get all the bitches" yet hasn't had a relationship since junior high.  SIipB looks rather like PewDiePie's disowned gay brother. Or possibly sister.  And touchandagree? Yeah, I don't know anyone who would agree to touch that.
This is is our sorry collection of moderators/control freaks. God help us all.  And not a one over the age of 13!
Royal Llama is a feminist who claims that it's normal to identify your gender as a unicorn.
aresniccrazy: Those damn eyebrows are thicker than those noodle arms. Seems like you are struggling to hold up the paper Draculix: I can only assume that since the rest of your face looks to be as matured as a 3 year old, that 'facial hair' is borrowed enzo32ferrari: Between the eyes, nose and eyebrows, I am going to assume your face is just random mr. potato pieces attached to an actual potato Fungax: If you are going to show your chest, I suggest having hair on it, toddler OnThe_Pursuit: I bet you are that quirky guy that throws out puns and jokes...and everyone just pity laughs for you. Be prepared, everything you get will be 'pity' RoyalLlama: Your man hands and your lesbian hair have me stumped on which direction to go, either way, for my sake, hoping it isn't for men SIipB: Dyed platinum hair? Music freak? How many Bieber concerts have you been to? SimplifyEUW: I be you get everything you want from your mom and yet lash out like a spoiled 12 year old...even though she breast feed you till you were 7. Ungrateful fuck... tamallamaluv: I bet your parents can't wait for you to be forced married off for the chickens. Atleast you will then be useful for something touchandagree: You are so fucking bland, the only way you could have an existance was to mod on reddit. Way to shoot for the stars
arseniccrazy---a 5 out of 10 but worthy of a bath, a meal and some touching in those special places.  couple of the oddball female types are upsetting even to me  touchandagree is is 3 out of 10.  Probably already brokeback.  SimplifyEUW looks like jailbait, but what do I know....I've been there done that  Onthe_Pursuit probably wears little girl underwear, but we could hit Walmart for some more upscale attire  
Person who gives me the funniest comment will get all of their roast comments personally vetted by me in consideration for the next Best Of.
Mods so stupid they cant even follow their own rules.    The only one who could be proud of you is Koalemos 
What the fuck is /u/RoyalLlama? Boy or girl?
Slipb = emo link
/u/SlipB is that a photo of a priest on your goddamn doors?
Great.  We're being led by the ticket booth employees at Comic Con
RoyalLama looks like Larry Bud Melman's lesbian mom....... https://www.reddit.com/r/ObscureMedia/comments/3cpox2/larry_bud_melman_of_late_night_with_david/?
/u/Royallama look like a dive bar Rosie O'Donnell
so 9 out of 10 are gay, but gay headphones is prettier than douchey gay hat
/u/RoyalLlama You look like you're dressed up as your lesbian mom and about to stab some young girl in the shower behind you.
/u/RoyalLlama: Was that your boyfriends reaction when he realised neither of you knew what gender you are
I wouldn't employ any of them. They all look like self entitled boobs. Ok, one of them might show some promise but the rest are  flushable. 
aresniccrazy:  Draculix:  enzo32ferrari:  Fungax:  OnThe_Pursuit:  RoyalLlama:  SIipB:  SimplifyEUW:  tamallamaluv:  touchandagree:  Here's a template :D first person to attempt to roast all of us wins a VERY special flair courtesy of myself :D
a-crazy looks like a bottom  slipb is fuckable --only after a few six packs  I'd take simplifyeuw home for the weekend, and return him in better condition  I wouldn't touch 'touchandagree' with anyones dick, hands or even a big stick
To /u/Draculix , Your face says baby, your beard says child molester.
/u/draculix looks like the kind of guy who hangouts by a high school after they get released and browses tinder. 
OK, arseniccrazy looks like a possible.  the rest?  I've seen a better collection of retards at the ARC Center.
/u/Draculix plays blind man's bluff with newspapers
/u/RoyalLlama, You look like a transgender [Clark Griswold] (http://blogs.mydevstaging.com/blogs/dadabase/files/2013/08/Clark-Griswold.jpg)  /u/Draculix, Your face is the same shape as a water jug.  /u/enzo32ferrari, I'm afraid they don't do beanie hats in xxxxxl.   /u/SIipB, If you didn't spend all your money on hair products you would be able to buy some full size posters.
Are you guys *required* to either be douchey hipsters (/u/Fungax, /u/OnThe_Pursuit, /u/RoyalLlama) basement-dwelling creeps (/u/arseniccrazy, /u/SimplifyEUW) or asian (/u/enzo32ferrari, /u/SIipB, /u/tamallamaluv)?
You're all a solid 10.    I can't roast any of you.  But I can add 1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1, and give you a solid 10. 
1 to the power of 10... As in 1 normal human has a higher vitamin D level than these 10 moderators 
u/fungax looks like if Larry the Cucumber from Veggie Tales was a person.
Hey /u/tamallamaluv, you look like the asian version of Meg from Family guy, and that's still enough to make /u/SimplifyEUW jerk it to you every night
/u/arseniccrazy looks like the kind to tell you to skip school the next Friday.  &amp;nbsp;  /u/tamallamaluv looks like she has no depth perception, simply because her eyes are so close together.  
I see a bunch of anti-social nerds, 2 hipsters, an Asian dude trying too hard to be white, a lesbian, and then one girl who was seen the outside world on the past 10 days. On a more serious note, you all should be getting drunk and hooking up while at college instead of approving crappy photos of high school kids trying to show they're edgy. 
They should call this /r/millinealtrash
Hi, sorry, I'm new here. Is there some kind of hidden rule which says if someone posts a request for roast, and every roaster agrees that's the biggest tard of the year, op becomes a moderator? This is the only reason i can think of when i see those faces
Enzo32 looks like he fell in a funnel, feet first..almost made it..... Damn his head.
Great, I ended up on /r/PermaVirgins.
You do know that the nearest K-12 school is at least 4 miles away.
/u/Draculix - Looks like an older and less successful version of Jimmy Newtron  
Your ages explain the quality of the moderation here, at least.
/u/OnThe_Pursuit you should consider working in porno cause you've got the 'looking up at a dude while sucking his dick look' covered.
/u/touchandagree you look like Christian Slater taking a shit and reminiscing about the glory days.
/u/Draculix the reason people are always uncomfortable around you is because of the vagina placed where your mouth should be. You should consider drawing less attention by not trying to grow pubes around it.
/u/tamallamaluv you look like the kind of person that would offer really good dating advice while giving a pedicure.
SlipB - running the world's first web based assisted suicide site, where he lisps his way through some boyband covers of nirvana tracks whilst the other person slowly shuffles off this mortal coil...  RoyalLlama - grow your beard back, Kevin Smith!
Arseniccrazy look the type of dude to shoot up his high school because a girl wouldn't go to prom with him.
/u/enzo32ferrari looks like the child of E.T. and Wiz Khalifa, if E.T. drank while pregnent.  
[deleted]
/u/OnThe_Pursuit you look like the only person who hates you more than yourself is your mom for having you 
It seems like you either have to have a fivehead or emo hair to be a mod
/u/touchanddisagree
/u/SlipB: Listening to eminems albums on repeat still doesn't justify that teenage albino crisis of a barnet
/u/touchandagree you the sort of guy that makes parents really anxious all night after leaving you babysitting their children 
Draculix is proof Neil Patrick Harris fucked Chaz Bono. 
If Bert and Ernie from sesame street went on a holiday to thailand and Bert raped Ernie, this is what the result would be after Ernie contracted the Zika virus.
Voi jukuptk sentn, voi herranen aika sentn, voi kikkeliskuuhun ja muna suuhun, se on huiki-harvinainen SUOMALAINEN KRISTYS /u/SIipB:lle  Toisaalta, tuolla tukalla ja noilla seinill, muna suuhun ei vlttmtt ole kovin harvinainen tapaus.
