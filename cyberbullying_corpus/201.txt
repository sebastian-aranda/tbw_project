"My friend"  C'mon OP, let's be honest; you gave a homeless person on the train a blowjob to hold that bag just for karma.
Did you know if you look closely at the new Wendy's logo on that bag, that her collar says "MOM". The marketing people added this subliminal advertising because to the general public it projects the image of home and feeling like family.  Again, it works for the general public, but I wanted to explain this to you because it's clear you grew up homeless and your mom left right after you were born.  
Looks like a mug shot from some sex offenders website
I can't tell which had more grease, the bag or your hair 
You're the poster boy for homeless ISIS rejects.
Does your boss know that you're defacing paper bags? Because if he tells your parole officer it's back to getting buggered by Jerome in the big house for you.
You look like you started your own chapter of Sons of Anarchy. So far you're the only member. It's been three years.
You know, if you kicked your drug habit, you might be able to afford real paper?
I don't pick on the homeless.
It must be nice to work from home. Your a hand jobber on the bus right?
