You've definitely considered both joining the military and "being a professional gamer." Both aren't viable options.
on the bright side, you'll never have to spend a cent on condoms
Your parents probably hung those drapes over the door in your room so they could talk to you without looking at you.
Good move putting your glasses up, you look so cool all the sudden. 
I remember being 15. Perpetual hardon and all your friends had theirs---sooner or later you all do a reacharound
fuck outta here. do some homework and jerk off into a sock, or whatever kids do today. 
I bet you have aspirations of being a professional gamer, and getting laid someday. You won't, and you won't.
You look like someone who has lots of tantrums during your live twitch feeds.
Do you wear headphones so you don't have to listen to your parents disappointment?
this is a really good look for you; what do you call it? girlfriend repellent?
You're that one sophomore who is in at least one of everybody's class, but manages to have no one to hang out with.   
That $5 print on your wall completely explains your tentacle fetish.
I think your education failed you there is no space between "roa" and "st" and writing in all caps doesn't help. 
You look like such a generic ass kid. No one will remember you ever. 
Who the hell roasts their toast?
Professional call of duty gamer
15 is a tough age. Neither animal nor mineral but hormonal to the max. I can see you will and are very popular with the EMO boys.
