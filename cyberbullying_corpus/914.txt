Didn't know Walter Jr from Breaking Bad had a fraternal twin.

Were you dressed by Helen Keller?
Calling himself a vape lord is enough of a roast

Whats for breakfast, dayud?
You're the reason why pajama pants were against my schools dress code
bean pole  good thing mom gets EBT money,

Congrats on overcoming your autism.
