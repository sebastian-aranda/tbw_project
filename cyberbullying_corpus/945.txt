You've got the upper body of Jeff Tweedy, but the hips of a middle aged woman.
Your hair looks like a bad toupee
Your face looks like a bad connect the dots
Ellen Degeneres called; she wants her body (and hairstyle) back.
i'd be afraid of starting a grease fire.
Can't hear you over the noise of your thighs rubbing together. 
I don't usually recommend plucking eyebrows to lesbians such as yourself - but in your case, I'm making an exception.
I don't know if it is your thighs, your pose, or your face. But I would enjoy uppercutting you
If you were one of my french girls, I wouldn't wait for the sinking of Titanic to die.
French girls lay on the makeup to cover the crop of pimples....you look like your boyfrind stomped  on your face with golf cleat s
fabulous!  Those tight pants beginning to hurt? 
You been practicing that look for quite sometime. Has it  been productive?  
You look like you smell like piss.
You have the kind of face that says "I'm not capable of coloring inside the lines," but shut my mouth right up. 
I can tell by your clothes that you're from a poor family. Your Jack and Jones t-shirt is cheap tat and your jeans are shitty quality. Appears that your father (if you even know who he is) is just as big a fucking failure as you. Get a hair cut, apply yourself in school and don't make the same mistakes as your loser of an old man.
