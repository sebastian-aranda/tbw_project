I'm sure your body will always be ready. Just like the fire extinguisher in the hallway of your school. It will never be used
[I like this picture of you better](http://i.ytimg.com/vi/bhuYIr1J1zc/maxresdefault.jpg)
I hope you open that letter and it says you have cancer 
if you believe in yourself, you can probably get the right side of your mouth to touch your right eye. don't give up!
I'm betting you have a baby on the way. Your religion and mom won't let you abort the baby, so you'll spend the rest of your life trying to support your new family by waiting to get picked for day labor jobs alongside your dad in a Home Depot parking lot.
You look like every Latino man in every rental car commercial. 
Hows managing the local McDonald's going
No, no your body isn't ready to get touched by a girl.
It's like your eyes can't decide whether they want to be squinty or far apart.
Is that envelope for your mail order bride?
It looks like your body is ready to transplant the hair on your knuckles to your face to complete your pathetic attempt of a beard
The oil on your nose is shinier than the ring on your finger.
I don't think your pubic hair is supposed to be on your chin, then again it's probably running like all the children you flash on the street... 
... yet your face looks like it's still molting.
im sure you have a vast collection of magic the gathering located someone in your room.
the inquisition called, they want you back 
No one else's body will ever be ready for you.
You look like the seedy gay latino who gets eiffel-towered by two hulking black guys you met that night at a club. 
Your body is ready, but that hair is not. 
Hers never will be though.
those lips have seen a lot of action
**pukes up in my mouth a bit-then a lot!*
I never thought I would agree with Trump. Then I saw your stupid fucking face.
