Are you a guy or a girl?
/r/AwfullyPunchableFaces
Your face is one whole color, go outside.
You took brokeback mountain a little too serious 
You're the personification of the Uncanny Valley
Absolutely fabulous hair ,now if one could do something about the nose and the rest of that face , it would be almost perfection !!
With a nose that big I'm sure you can smell the "you're a retard" jokes coming from a mile away.
Be nice to OP, xe is just trying to find xemself 
so, what exactly are you?
You look adopted.
I can hear you clapping sarcastically through my phone. 
You need to have your face grinded into a cheese grater - may hell your chances with women 
That nose is just crying to get broken.
You'd be lucky if a serial killer who had a fetish for gender confused females would rape you and leave you in a ditch.
