Oh, I'm sure you're the coolest guy in your Renn Faire troupe.  
Who are you trying to fool son? The only thing you are studying is some random guys asshole in a dark back alley.
You look like a Japanese white kid
This guy definitely knows all his karate moves from Bruce Lee video clips
Looking like Shun Yu's second-hand man and shit.
If you keep on studying psychology no bronies will be able to argue with you at the conventions.
you're the type of kid freud was talking about...
Are you the main attraction?  You have that look about you that screams  5150
You look like you constantly ask people would they like to see a magic trick.
wheres your leather wrist bands?! im pretty sure you have convinced yourself that trying to imitate characters from game of thrones will help you with the ladies..maybe youll find one dumb enough to fall for it! and i didnt know you need a psychology degree to serve coffee.
Is your neck so long cause you stretched it out trying to see into the next stall in the mens room?
