You win this round, Joel -- I can't lower your self-esteem any more than what the genetic lottery has clearly already done.
You want us to rate you or your zits Joel?
Doge coin is about as likely to go to the moon as you losing your virginity before the teens are over. 
Thanks for the potato quality, seeing you in HD would be a felony.
Your shirt says to the moon because you'd have more friends there than you do on earth 
I'm thinking you will sink much much lower before this is over
"Dear Em,  It's Stan again...."
I would lower your self esteem but i fear it would make your neck longer. 
So can we assume your GRINDR profile was deleted?
