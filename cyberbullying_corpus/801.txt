I actually laughed out loud looking at picture 3
You look like quarantined nerds.
1.) Your head looks like an over-inflated balloon  2.) (left) you look about as sure about this roast as your mom probably did giving you that haircut (right) you look like the bratty niece from Finding Nemo got her ass whooped by puberty  3.) I'm not even gonna roast you you look one bad insult away from shooting up the school 
At least y'all have each other
Omg, I loved you in The Goonies.
Nerd squad!
