So you're even boring to your imaginary friends? 
So....they blow you this time 
I really got nothing and would just sound like some bitch if I asked why dude has a ladder for a shelf.
You're looking at your creepy Uncle who will be standing over your sleeping form breathing heavily this evening, aren't you? I know the look on your face so well...I see it every night in the mirror...
I would roast you, but I am sure the mirror does a good enough job everyday.
Hopefully the ladder leads him to the noose hanging from the ceiling
Guys, never post a roast on a whim... at least not with a face like that.
while I probably could make some half arsed reference towards you slightly resembling Jonathan Levinson from Buffy: The Vampire Slayer, the television series... really, I look at your sacrifice and feel like singing [Springtime For Hitler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHmYIo7bcUw) because I feel more pokemon than your friends and your arse, so I jew you.
That nose was the reason why your mom's vagina is so stretched out that your dad left shortly after you were born.
Even the cock gods are not interested kid
