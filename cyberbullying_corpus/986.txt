You look like Rick Astley and Justin Bieber had a lesbian baby  When you were born the Dr. Thought he was getting rick-rolled  Your tattoo looks like  The bottom of your father's shoe left an imprint from trying to hold you down in the bath tub 
I recognise those ears, shouldn't you be returning the ring to mordor
You thought a shitty tattoo of a burnt waffle was a good idea.
You have the physique of a toddler, the tattoo of a mindless broseph and the hair of a 90s failed boy band member. How many ways are you trying to confuse the gay community?

Youre the abortion JGL and Ellen DeGeneres didn't want
You remove your condoms by farting
Back in the closet you go
Your bra is sticking out
Your ears look like they are trying to escape from you. Can't blame em.
That trainer bra is showing
I would if you tell if it's a girl place or a boy place.
Hurrah!  You got your first date with the quarterback on the football team. How lucky. I bet you will be sore in the morning.
You'll need a tracheal shave to pass off as a woman, other than that so far so good 
How is being an aging, Rosie O'Donnell-esque Ruby Rose working out for you?
Why so happy?  Did your sister-cousin say yes?
He looking like he just lost his gag reflex and loved every second of it.
