You suck
Your "Affliction" shirt in the wash?
You look like he type of guy that got a tattoo because you thought it might get you laid. Your sleeve looks almost as terrible as your aesthetic, terrible fashion sense trying to rep clothing meant for 20 somethings, yet you're like what? 35? You have this urge to fit in, yet you look painfully out of place, an old man reaching out for his youth.
Your last words will be "Im not drunk, watch this"
I'm surprised you didn't take this picture in front of your 1998 lifted Dodge Ram. 
You look like a full size version of mini me
If Bruce Willis and Vin Diesel somehow gave birth to an autistic son. 
You look like you're seconds away from chugging a Monster and going outside to do scooter tricks. 
You look like a stay at home dad in a mid life crisis

Which of your buddies' trailers did you break into for this picture, just so we wouldn't see that you live out of your '86 Pontiac Fiero, such a SWEEEET ride!
Your "M" stole your hairline.
You look like an ape wearing a man suit.
You look like you listen to Disturbed
I think someone threw-up on your arm, mate
Keep telling yourself that you're the cool dad.
It's a shame that your hairline and ass crack start at the same place.
Move along Pedo move along. 
I'm not sure I want to roast you... you look like the type of guy who cries enough
I bet you have more Ed Hardy tattoos than you do keys on your carabiner.
Your tattoo looks like someone with both Tourettes and Parkinson's did it for you.
You look like Alexi Sayles http://www.wearysloth.com/Gallery/ActorsS/tve15386-19821109-373.jpg
