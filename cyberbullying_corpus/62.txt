Oh boy, looks who's ready for 'Pray Away The Gay' camp!
You planned out being a hipster because all of your friends did it and you wanted to finally be cool.

Wow! You didn't brush your teeth before bed last night. Man you are Edgy.
If you were my son you'd probably find my head blown off in the garage one morning.
