You look like you have just received your std test results back and you are not sure if positive is good or bad.
Youre the type of dude who hands out invitations to his Halloween party that say "7 - ???" on them, then it ends at 7:30
Hello Unroastable Faggots, i'm dastye, nice to meet you
Just another douchebag, wannabe hipster.  Nothing to see here!
You look like the kind of asshole who still uses 'faggot' as an insult.
You have that look about you. That look that screams....SOMEONE FROM THE MAN SIDE COME FUCK ME&gt;..
All that confidence in your title line, yet you don't even have the balls to look directly at the camera
Do you always look like you're 2 seconds away from spewing vomit?
Must you project your insecurities onto us?
You look like you just saw a giant dick and you love it, but you don't want anyone to know.
Oh look, the "I spend all day taking up a table at Starbucks so I can pretend to write on my shit Apple" frames are back in style.
Its Joe Buck's sidekick: Five head boy!
I have a feeling that we'll see this pic again in 20 years, just replace the "roast me" sign with a County Lock Up mug shot info board, and a scroll bar underneath it that quotes neighbors describing you as "the quiet one. He never bothered anyone, he just kept to himself." All of this is in a pic-in-pic on the screen, while the main feed from CNN shows the deputies removing the severed limbs of missing boys from your fridge.  People just assume that you were behind the disemboweled pets left on people's doorstep.  
Looks like Rachel Madow  with low self esteem.
This is the best shot your mom could take while at Chess club? And by chess club I mean at home because the kids there don't even like you.
I was going to say that you forgot the comma in your title... But I don't think you did. 
You have a balloon shaped face.
Not even maggots would touch you.
