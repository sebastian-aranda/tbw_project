Weak and unoriginal were actually the first two words that came to mind when i saw your picture. You look like the blandest poser. If you were icecream youd be milk flavored
Someone in your position really shouldnt be throwing around the word "unoriginal". You fucking define the term "generic teenage douchebag"
Looks like your biggest dilemma in life would be free ham.
In a few years, people will think of you as "that guy who tried to get a rap career started, where is he now", not realizing that's still exactly where you are, and where you will be for the next thirty years, before the drinking starts to *really* take it's toll and you're found facedown in a pool of your own excretions.
You look like the Nigga that gets shot by a dude wearing a motorcycle helmet in every single Brazil video.
Do you velcro your hat on?
Those lips are swollen from long term cock sucking. You swallow? Your skin shows extra proteins.
 His hat says "I just want to dance papi." His eyes say, "I just want to clean Holmes".
You look like Drake had sex with a potato, and you were unlucky enough to inherit Drake's penis size.
It's hard to come up with something witty when everyone is distracted by the 2 fuzzy caterpillars you glued to your forehead.
Little pretty boy there. Keep that skin moisturizer a flowing, those old men love your soft tender texture.  And your ass.
You should be incredibly thankful for the disastrous ski jump of a nose. I mean, it's so fucking wide you could drive a semi-truck down it, but it's the only thing keeping your already too close together eyes apart. 
If you were able to donate eyebrow hair. You would be able to help at least 3 people who need eyebrows with those fucking hedges on your face.
Tell your mom I said hi. Next time you get out of the basement that is....
You look like you'll join the high school yearbook committee to make sure you can look pretty in any picture they use of you.
