You look like you graze your ears when you walk through a door.
You could probably stop traffic. Not because you're handsome or anything, you just have the jaw line of a stop sign. 
Now that you've subjected me to that face both of us feel like shit. 
I have a soup tureen with similar handles either side.  
I see some paint came off the wall when you were taking down your Nickleback poster for this picture. Better have your parents drive you to Home Depot to pick up a tiny brush and touch up pail of "Cornflower Blue" paint.
Maybe you can fly away from your feelings with those ears. 
Your face looks like the after product of playing the [Mario Stretch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWOJq2aDac0) game.
Your face looks like a bag full of assorted cheekbones.
If this is the view your penis sees everyday, I wouldn't blame it if it shriveled up and died of shame.
Those ears!  Flap em in the wind this kid would lift off the ground
/remindme to check in a few years to see if this kid can grow facial hair and not scattered pubes on face 
If it feels like shit, and looks like shit, it's probably shit. 
Your ears stand out more than the blue paint
 his mom must sneezed right before your head popped out  and then my friend said: you look like when you were being born the doctors pulled you out by your ears

you got frisbees sticking out of your head man?
You're not even worth the fucking time. 
Looks like you wrote "r/roastme" on the back of your half-assed suicide note.

Feeling like shit?  It's because of your long face.
It's ok, kid... being gay will be much easier when you get to college.
