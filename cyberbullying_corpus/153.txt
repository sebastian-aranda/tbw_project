Wow you are one sad middle aged cat woman librarian.
So you are the lady who buys Randy Jackson glasses from LensCrafters. 
another native american princess waiting for her indian card, yes, dear, you should study up on algebra because hey, who knows in a year you could be working the casinos or if they reject you moving to your other career option of a drug dealer... you've already got the couch for it. (the kind of couch that gradually swallows your body, while one's dealer keeps telling you stories and loading you up on the house, yet you're desperately eyeing the door hoping your roommate hasn't panicked and already drove off... leaving your arse for dead or arrest, when all you need them to do is come in, give you an uncooked poptart, cuz man do you have the munchies and pry your arse off the couch... cuz dude, that couch will be your lifeline to some semblance of a social life.)
I honestly cannot tell what gender you are.   I bet you are one of those people whom has a Polish grandparent or two and then calls themselves Slavic so they can distinguish themselves because they are so brutally ordinary and forgettable. 
Stop being lazy, I bet your boyfriend in the background can supply the mirror in his makeup kit.
