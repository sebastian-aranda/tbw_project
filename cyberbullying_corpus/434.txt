You're androgynous and look like a blunder
I bet you get a lot of confused looks from priests
You look like the type of girl that looks back and thinks they are so much better than their peers from high school but the reality is they don't even remember who you are.
I bet you have a LOT of pubic hair.
You might be 20, but you look like you've got experience holding a knife to someone's throat.
your instagram bio probably says something about rainy days, cats, and flavored coffees.
it's unsettling how much you look like a 12 year old boy. Not even gonna try to be clever about it, I am just deeply troubled by your appearance.
You also played the feral kid from Mad Max. Except he had less shit on his face. 
Please, stop goofing off on your school-provided laptops. Just because your friends play Minecraft during class doesn't mean you have to join in. Once you get to high school you'll wish you'd started the habit of work. 
*From the pen of u/guanoinsane,*  *Today marks the third month without shower.*  *Can't tell if an animal died on my scalp, or if it's just my hair.*  *Deodorant doesn't work anymore, sprayed febreze on myself.*  *Thank god my sense of smell committed suicide, but I smell so bad I think I taste it.*
You look like Bolbi with long hair and bad hygiene 
You look like the kid AJ from the Sopranos if he had a sex change and the doctor had a heart attack in the exact middle of the operation.
You look like a used up old cumdump
I'll bet your daddy taught you to say that.
&gt;but look younger  Keep telling yourself that. 
 Male   Female   Hermaphrodite   Jury still out   Who cares, it's ugly
You look 22 dude
