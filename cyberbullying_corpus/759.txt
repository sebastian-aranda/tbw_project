You look like you weren't bullied enough as a child.
I'll give you my worst when you get out of the closet.
Your nose is getting brolic from lifting those glasses all day.
You look like the kid that would ask the hottest girl in school to a dance, but instead of her saying yes, she'll give you an awkward sympathy half-song slow dance.
Y'know you could have waited until the cactus had been removed before taking the photo.
Kid, I'm gonna spare you tonight, because the next 5-10 years for you is going to be on the verge of suicidal hell.
Somewhere in the UK there are several old men chokin their chickens over your picture
