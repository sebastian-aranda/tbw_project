Probably because you're not ugly enough to get their sympathy nor pretty enough to get their attention 
"Hey, the art teacher wants to be roasted."  "The pretty one?"  "No, the other one." 
Your account is just posting loads of peoples pictures to be roasted?
You seem like that piece of shit that posts vague, depressing, statuses on Facebook. Then when people ask what the problem is you say "I don't wanna talk about it".   EDIT: How does this comment have more karma than the actual post?
Probably because they offered you a brush and deodorant.
looks like you've been practicing your "disinterested" face for quite some time now. probably easy to replicate after seeing so many guys give you the same look.

Ew ew ew your nails! I don't have a good roast, just do something about those nails, goddamn
Sometimes in movies there's a nerdy female character that suddenly becomes hot and popular just by taking off her glasses. You would be that character's whiny friend who ends up getting left-behind in the second half of the movie.

You look like you spend your workday pretending to review spreadsheets but actually reading about serial killers on wikipedia.   On another note, you look freakishly similar to an old roommate I had.

You are a beautiful young lady.... You should smile more.
You are mildly attractive. 
You hate people because you feel that no one can truly understand you and what you have/are going through. However, the simple truth of the matter is... everyone struggles with something at some point. It's what makes us all human. Even though this was supposed to be a roast response, I felt it necessary to, in this situation, address the fact that with a better outlook on life and smile on your face, you would be more attractive than the majority of assholes on reddit could ever hope for.   Downvote away... D.I.L.L.I.G.A.F.
You already have the glasses, so you are on the path of cat woman/spinster.  Edit: I embrace your downvotes.
