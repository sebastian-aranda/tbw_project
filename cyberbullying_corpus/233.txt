Why not use that 30 minutes learning something that will actually make a difference in your life, like learning how to tie a noose?
30 minutes? That's nothing. You're mom spent 9 months working on your face and she fucked up. At least you both have something in common: Failures.
Looks like you left a pube in your boyfriend's teeth
I think there is an awkward conversation with your parents about how you and your guy friend are more than just friends in your near future
You wear long sleeves to hide your scrawny arms
"...And will spend 30 years not having sex."
Should have spent two minutes doing something about that fucking eyebrow. 
I assume by "doing" you mean "having sex with". 
Your friend wants to spend 30 minutes doing your dinky willy. 
I see a couple of gay kids, waiting for some old man to scoop them up.
you look like you spend 30mins on your hair cos your boyfriend just jacked off on your face 
Ugh.
It took you 30 minutes to pull off the Donald Trump look?
So much time on your hair you'd think you gave a shit about your eyebrows
This looks like a photo test shot for their JustUsBoys magazine cover and bukkake pictorial. 
you stuck your head in the garbage disposal for 30 minutes? srsly, what kind of homo brags about how long it took him to do his hair? he looks like donald trump on a windy day
