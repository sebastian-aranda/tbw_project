I'm assuming you use the talk-to-text feature on your phone because there is no way those fat hippo legs for thumbs can type.
sure, you like it rough.. and the powder puff tuft at the front of your head is the handle the lads use to hang-on.. I'm guessing they're all native americans, behold the great white water buffalo. 
You look like Ron Perlman's rape child. 
Is that hair puff there for your boyfriend to hold your head down?
You are an overweight ginger neckbeard with bad hair, bad eyesight, and bad teeth.   Wow, didn't even need to be creative there. The photo says it all.
So you have a toilet plunger stuffed up your ass. Ok. Carry on. So to speak.
Your teeth look like corn
you look like you love playing with little kids. too bad you're not a father, though.
I'm sure your father can attest to that.
