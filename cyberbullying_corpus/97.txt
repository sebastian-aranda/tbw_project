How terrible is it that your only conversation starter is a crater on your forehead?
Your forehead looks like a clean ashtray.
What the hell is going on with the forehead?  You get dropped out some window as an infant?
The last thing you held in your teeth that way were your sister's panties 
Why did you quit your job as a forehead ashtray?
Your forehead looks like the surface of the moon

You never peaked in high school, so you have a frohawk and try to do and say "hip" things in your mid 30's it looks like?
