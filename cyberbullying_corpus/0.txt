You look like a transitioning female to male that has been taking hormones for 4 years and is now proud to show off their facial hair. How's your Subaru and softball team doing? 
It's like Wes Bently couldn't stop eating those berries.
You look like you disappoint your family often
you look like you should be mounted on a wall next to a bear... the mark of the truly fearless hunter "look at this beast its hideous"
This guy spends way too much time grooming to be this fucking ugly.
So, how's your "husbear"??
Whenever I'm about to argue with someone on the internet, I assume they look like you, so I don't even bother.
Looking fly! Loving the beard
