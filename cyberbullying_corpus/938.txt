Jeez, what's the matter with you? Why keep coming back here? You look like a potato accept it and move on with you life.  
Are you Stan from American dad?
You look like a Mr. Potato head with a chin tumor. 
You look like a marshmallow that somebody dotted with red sharpie. Also, you have a really weird face that looks photoshopped but not in a flattering way. The longer I look at your picture the more I begin to doubt that you exist.
When I connect those dots on your face it spells fetal alcohol syndrome
I believe your face is too small for your head.
Your face looks like it's been destroyed too many times already.
I have never in my life seen such a well rounded head before. Perfect oval shape. 10/10.
Forget another round of roasting, you look like you want another round of chicken nuggets
Your pale skin makes you look like a naked mole rat
Flea bites all over your face?
Boy u look an uncooked chicken breast
