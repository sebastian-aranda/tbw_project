The only thing you should have laid on thick is some acne treatment
turn around and pay attention to your parole officer, meth-nose.
I'm pretty sure your mom did meth when you were in the womb
The first year Rudolph questioned his job security.
Zit right on the end of the nose. I can see why the girls are laughing and the boys are telling you to turn around and bend over
I think Rudolph just met his replacement
Thicker than the layer of grease in your nose
Chill it with the meth man, you've already got Stage one Fetty Wap eye.
