could make a fucking biker jacket with that neck meat
So the crimson chin does exist
Gold V? It must be easier to play with a mouse up your ass than i thought 
I don't know what gold v is, but I bet the V stands for virgin.
Just hit 300 lbs too.
Grats on getting Gold V on LAN
Gold V? Congratulations, you're mediocre.
You look like a tube of toothpaste 
You are such a failure, ur holding your roast paper like you won an award...
Your head is as blokko as a nokko
So your the one who sits in class in short pants without underwear? No one notices.
So I guess that's the only thing you got going for you in your life... Which is nice.
Which game are you talking about noob?
Your head is so square that you look like a Lego piece
is one side of your chin trying to eat your face?
You probably got there by maining Master Yi, Annie, and Teemo
I bet when you were a kid, you had a huge head. 
Gold V is the only thing you'll ever hit.
Your neck fat shows us you prefer roast(s) over exercise 
And im gonna hit your brick of a face
That's strange... Someone edited your face to appear like GTA3 people? http://www.gouranga.com/images/gta3/gta3_14.jpg
Gold V wont change your face. I can hear your whiny voice from here.

Golden V is the only kind of V you'll ever... see.
