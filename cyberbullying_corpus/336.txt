I would roast you but there is always that small chance you go to the same school as me.
Your hair looks like the haircut you give a 2 year old.
How much you charge?
I hope you're working on a plan to trim that shrubbery above your eyes.
what do you work as..   an old navy mannequin?   a [flowbee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3G1cwqYkO4) model?  an undercover cop dealing with crimes in the sixth grade and selling upskirt shots on the side?
did you glue your hair on?  this is the result of mini me having sex with ellen degeneres
This is what happens when parents cut their kids hair to save a few bucks.
Your only hope is that your tasteless haircut will eventually cover the gap in between your eyes. 
You look like Fred from Scooby Doo minus a chromosome
