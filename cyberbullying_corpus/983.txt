You look like that one Mormon friend that nobody actually likes
I would, but its politically incorrect to make fun of gay guys nowadays.
Your clothing says Jehovah's Witness but your eyes say Serial Rapist.
Look like a current or future serial killer
You look like you could be a spokesman for people who had a rough childhood
Your dead eyes make me think you were molested as a kid.
You look like one of those door to door Jehovah's witnesses no one likes.
You look like someone who volunteers at church a lot, just hoping to win the approval of the priest who touched you as a child then threw you to the side as you got older.
You picture is screaming for some elder to take you in the ass. 
You look like one of Jared's boy toys that got too old and contracted HIV...subway eat fresh
You need to dress yourself a little bit better. Your shirt is hanging out, your zipper is not closed, but you butt is available for any guy to enter.
wait, you are a virgin?!? I would have never guessed that!
You look like an anaemic Tom Hiddleston.  In Thor, you'd play "Low-key".
Here we see a future Mormon elder hoping desperately for a mission to someplace nice but getting sent to Nigeria where he contracts Ebola and dies from blood loss out of his ass. Best possible outcome for him, under the circumstances. 
Those 2 yr Mormon Missions usually turn into a two year bromance.
