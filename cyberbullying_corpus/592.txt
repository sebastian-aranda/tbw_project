With spelling skills like that, you can't be roasted more than you already did to yourself.  Seriously, the word you misspelled is LITERALLY in the title of this sub!
The funny thing is I noticed your weird looking upper lip before I noticed your spelling mistake.
You're one of those Indians on the tech help line that pretends to be called Steven, aren't you?
Did you leave out the top of your head because you're too sensitive of your balding?
that's all you fellas got? 
You didn't pay attention to rule #1 of this sub-reddit. You must have a sign that reads "roast me".
God put your eyes on crooked
Your Ugly.
