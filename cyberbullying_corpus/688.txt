You could meet people in person and they would still be mostly justified in asking 'A/S/L'? 
I noticed you post to r/childfree. Why do I get the feeling that life view isn't by choice?
im still trying to figure out ur gender
Not even joking, you are the absolute most androgynous person I've ever seen on this sub. You would be a shoo-in if they were ever casting for a sequel to "It's Pat."
You've either got an inverted penis or an everted vagina.
You look like a 13 year old Golden Girl.  You are blurring the lines between geriatric and pediatric. Tell me your names not Agatha.  You look like you would go trick or treating for thin mints and dried fruit.
You look like justin beibers evil twin if he was a boy...... Oh wait.
What the hell are you?
If left untouched, do your eyebrows make it all the way to your ears?

You burn coal. YOu always will burn coal.
