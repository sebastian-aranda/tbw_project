If your face was any more oily the United States would invade it.
Right there is a physical representation of Frost's poem.  You probably bloomed last decade but you snorted too much, tattooed yourself, stopped taking care of yourself then have to wear free promotional T-shirts from your peak year.  And. Your. Fucking. Nails.
And that still isn't the most balls you've had on your chest at once.  I'd hold onto that napkin, by the way. 
Your fingernails are afraid of those gopher teeth.
love that "just gang banged 27 guys" hair  your eyebrows look like the frito bandito's mustache  "nothing gold can stay." what the fuck does that mean, guys keep getting sick of your shit and taking their rings back?  you must really love tennis. i see you keep a couple of spare balls inside your shirt 
Your teen years were your gold,  so many dicks to hold.  giving men your flower,  on your back for hours.  but you're getting old and they say,  nothing gold can stay.  -Am also a fan of the poem, couldn't help but parody.-
Nothing gold can stay? Try painting your fingernails gold then, you goblin.
Another nail biting tweaker waiting for her pimp to get out of prison.
What, like the first needle prick that got you hooked or the first that led to your first teen pregnancy?
Pretty sure you got the "Most common white girl tattoo ever"
Go take a shower first.
