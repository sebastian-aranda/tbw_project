Leave it to a retarded rugby player to be wearing sunglasses, inside, at night
Semi-pro, translation: I wanted to play pro rugby, but I realized I was actually terrible
Just because a few crusty old dudes are willing to pay you a few quid so they can watch you and 29 guys in short shorts grapple at  each other like the end scene from Caligula for 80 minutes does not give you the right to wear Terminator sunglasses inside at night.

The fact that you've come this far means that you've got some speed and have fair ball handling skills. The cocky attitude and sunglasses at night tell me that you probably never pass the ball, can't tackle for shit and you are always more worried about your looks than the game. You are a mediocre fullback/winger.
You pc Bruh?
Rugby is so gay  yea it takes leather balls to play rugby
Hold me back!  This one is mine!  I specialize in this.
Did your mum have that 'life is too short to drink cheap wine' sign when she was pregnant with you?
Wearing sunglasses indoors at night? Looks like we have Mr. Cool over here. 
Is playing with the balls of a rugby player considered pro? or semipro? I thinking Charliewhall has spent a lot of time playing with the balls.
I can see in eyes he needs a big strong macho boy to take him to the prom.  
Also a semipro facial hair grower as well.
Who cut your hair? Looks like Ray Charles tried to play "Georgia" on your head with some buzzers attached to his hands
I guess that clock has bigger achievements than your career as a rugby player

Semipro bench warmer. You don't look like you could tackle a female winger.
Hmmm. More like Semi-noob. Now I know why you wear sunglasses at night, because your mind-set (plus a bunch of retards who also likes to wear a hat at night) is/are arithmetically small. This is why the concept of optimal population was made, for your parents to think of the future.

Must not be making any money, those sunglasses went of style decades ago.
Semi-pro rugby player?  Looks more like a semi-pro fluffer at a gangbang.  Nice sunglasses dude.  You can hide from the light but you can't hide from that complexion.  Face looks like a macadamia nut cookie.  And what's with the scruff?  You tape your friends pubes to your face to try out for the new Jackass?
