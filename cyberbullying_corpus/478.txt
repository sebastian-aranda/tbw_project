Grade 12 virgin huh? Hope you don't mind doing it another 18 years.
Yes, I'm sure you've convinced yourself that you like being a virgin. The reality is you're sad and depressed over it, and fear you will never get laid. So insteasd of losing weight, and becoming an interesting and successful guy girls want to be with, you instead put that effort into trying to convince yourself and others that you "Really don't care about it anyway." No one is buying it... *not even you.*

Which one of your chins is keeping you from getting laid?
You must be what not-famous Josh Peck would be like.
Well it's no wonder you're a virgin, you don't even have the confidence to look a camera in the eyes let alone a girl. You look like the type of guy that will one day get a hooked for the night to try and finally lose your virginity, but instead will spend the whole night talking, happy with the fact that someone is finally giving you the attention you don't deserve. 
If there was any chance you could've seen your reflection on the camera it's for the best that you looked away.
