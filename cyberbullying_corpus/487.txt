Looks like a drone will do that for us in a minute
Here's a story for you.  When I was a lad, I had a Mr. Potato Head. I *hated* the thing. I tortured it, I smashed it into things, I shot it with a potato gun, and generally wrecked the thing.  It all came to a peak recently, when I dug it out of the loft, and stood it in a hot pan. Then I watched it melt. Its' happy face slowly became an unrecognisable mess, and it turned into a sad-looking, miserable pile of mush in a relatively potato-ish colour.  You know?  You *remind* me of that mess.
Can't tell if mexican farmer or terrorist.
It is like you are trying to stare at my genitals through the picture.
Did you get fucked in the anus, cause those bags under your eyes make it look like you didn't sleep for the past year. That is a lot of butt sex.
