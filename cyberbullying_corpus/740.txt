You look like someone shoved an extra chromosome into Elijah Wood.
Maybe you'd have some friends if you didn't have such a smug asshole look on your face.  You look like that guy at parties that everybody wants to punch in the head but can't quite understand why.
I don't think my oven is big enough to roast that forehead.
And this post you better swallow.
Maybe it barely singed you because you don't feel emotions anymore. I can see it in your fucking eyes, you asked to get roasted because you crave human interaction. Maybe you should give up the smug bullshit and go outside for once.
you look like you were playing with the vacuum cleaner and wanted to see what it felt like if you put it up to your mouth. 
Maybe you just aren't worth the time to roast?
You're just so completely average we can't think of anything to say. 
With this one I have an urgent need to piss.
Maybe try being interesting to look at. Like in any way at all.
