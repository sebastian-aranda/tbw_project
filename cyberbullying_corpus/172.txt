Your 35, your house is on wheels and your parents are very disappointed in you.

Keep drinking that natty light bro, after enough cases you might be able to add on another room to your trailer.
You're more full of piss than that Bud Light you're drinking.

I'm guess you're not a theologian, so I guess I'd be wasting my time collecting my notes on Jonas Proast, just to proast you, and continue my reign of unfunny, to quietly dismantle the status quo while laying brain slugs in the sluggish minds of millennials like yourself...   so, I'll just say you remind of my dad.. stinking worse than my colostomy bag and with nothing left to look forward to in life except the slim hope that my service dog might lick one of his nuts before he dies soberly alone.
