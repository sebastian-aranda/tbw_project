Is this a computer-generated image of what Quentin Tarantino's daughter would look like?
You look like the kind of guy who has his mothers underwear inder his pillow
You look like two face only rather than the right side side of your face being burned, it appears you've stroked out instead. 
That hoodie will do you good, pull it up over your face and save yourself the embarrassment. 
You look like you can't read. Say hi to your mom and tell her thanks for writing your roast sign
you have the perfect face for framing, i mean your face is literally a rectangle.
Depressed---LOL!
Holy shit, giraffe neck
You look like a 50 year old chain-smoking woman.
You look like a lonely lesbian that confuses good service from a waitress for love. 
Your Roast Me title is as boring and plain as your gender-neutral face.
you look like a old women who smokes all the time.'
