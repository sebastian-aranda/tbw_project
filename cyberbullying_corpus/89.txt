Is your girlfriend a blow up doll shaped liked wonder woman?
I didn't realize the X-Men needed a member whose superpower is making anyone who looks at him throw up.
First cousins are useful yeah?
Your necklace is as stupid as that look on your face. Are the raised eyebrows meant to imitate the look of shock on your "girlfriend's" face when she saw that sad, worn down penis of yours?
Literally none of those things is true. 
Lies, damned lies and statistics!
And I bet she loves the gifts you give her when she's between blowing basketball players
Good for you, kid. You'll go far.
His girlfriend is his grandma, his dad is in prison for child rape, and momma has a pimp named ScroooLoose.  Go figure!
Excelsior!
I bet being able to grill steak on your forehead was what you wrote as your mutant power when you applied for the X-men.
Someone should tell him you can't remove the hairs from his uni-brow with sand paper.

Honestly I don't think I can roast you if you have a girlfriend. Anyone who can make me legitimately question natural selection is impressive by my standards.
don't you miss those years as a twink sex-slave?
Too bad you can only afford hand-me-downs.
Do you choke off your "girlfriends" ball sack with that necklace so he can suspend his early ejack in your poop shoot.
You're the guy whose girlfriend gets pregnant and the baby comes out a different color.
