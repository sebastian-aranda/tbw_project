You are about two decades too old for that hair cut. 
Those eyes are screaming for some old man to scoop him up, make him his bride. Gotta be a limey. 
I'm sorry but with that face, I think your parents already did.
You're like 35 with the Justin Bieber hair, what's wrong with you? You've been dipping your stick in the kiddie pool too long, time for a girlfriend who isn't 13.
Your girlfriend give you a black eye? 
Someone already punched you in the eye for being who you are.    That's good enough for me.   
Are you wearing a chain?  lmfao
The bags under your eyes are deeper than the Mariana trench. 
You look like a real-life Randy Marsh without the mustache.
