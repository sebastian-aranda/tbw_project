Pull those jeans down a bit more, you might attract a boyfriend
You look like you smell your own farts.
It's a shame how you have been in the closet all these years and still don't have good fashion sense.
With that serial killer hand writing you never will. I imagine the notes you pass in class creep the girls out when you awkardly give it to them.
It looks like you have a handle bar mustache, but it doesn't matter because you don't have any girl to straddle your face 
I bet you know how many fingers fit up your butt.
No gf is due to you looking like Dahmer if Dahmer had downs.
