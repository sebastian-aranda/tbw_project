You ate a KitKat?  I know something that will bring you down.  You ate a KitKat.  *Alone*.  Because your friends have likely abandoned you in a manner similar to how Hitler's friends slowly began to leave him due to the fact he was inevitably going to be a failure.

Food can't replace love but I doubt you'll get to learn that
You look like every girl on Plenty of fish that starts out their profile 'my kids are my world'
Depression can. Just give it time. It looks to be working pretty well already.
