Even if you're trying to look like a shitty dollar-store Bob Saget, that Indian forehead dot throws everything off. 
Maybe not, but hopefully you can roast that shining, pulsating, disgusting zit off of your forehead
Foh you mythological Cyclops with that zit the size of Tallahassee
A Reds fan? That zit on your forehead is red hot compared to the Reds' winning record this year.
Look! It's a unicorn. 
That zit between your eyes will sprout into a 5" headlamp, which you will pop and eat in class.
