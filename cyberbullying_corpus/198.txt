You look like Michael Jackson modeling 90's athletic wear
Flaming, maybe. 
Are you the douchebag 'bad guy' from all of the shitty 90s comedies set in a ski resort, or were they just role models?
$40 a night rent boy
You look like you just got a Dirty Sanchez behind the homeless shelter.
You wear quirky glasses and thrift store coats to make you seem way more interesting than you really are. You're either empty on the inside or too stupid to realize how lame you are 
Well fuck, where do we begin? Between being in the awkward middle hair-length phase of *"I'm committing to having long hair because there's nothing else interesting about my looks and I sure as fuck can't grow facial hair like an actual man with testosterone"*- I see you've also thrown on a pair of androgynous sunglasses to again attempt to display having some sort of personality.   The jacket you so proudly display looks like something rummaged out of a Salvation Army, something you take pride in doing without realizing the point of going to a thrift shop is to find 1 maybe 2 treasures among a store that is literally *other people's fucking garbage*.   As if your overall lack of self-awareness isn't already an affront to anyone with taste or common sense- you covered up the /r/ of your own note which means either you're too dumb to have moved it down an inch **OR** when you saw this picture, uploaded it to imgur and posted to reddit you noticed it and said *"aw, this is good enough. If there's anything I believe in its that I should not try at all in life."* Which is ironic juxtaposed against the rest of your visage that just screams **TRYING TOO HARD**. 
$10 says you smell like cat pee and cheap cigarettes and stand wwaaayy too close to people in checkout lines.
If Tim Burton took a shit
Criss Angel inherited the chocolate factory.
I wanted to take a shower just by looking at you.
Holy fuck, you actually took the time trying to sculpt those dozen or so facial hairs.
You look like Prince if he was white and actually gay
Nobody has the heart to tell Stevie Wonder's child that he's albino...
You look like someone to wait in line to eat Mamas Boy on a Saturday morning just to say you went.
are you trying to bring back starter jackets or just homeless?
You look like you steal from your grandmother to pay for drugs 
Likes: Pretending to go for my wallet when the bill comes but letting someone else "beat me to it".  Dislikes: Date rape awareness campaigns.  Hobbies: Thinking people think I look like Johnny Depp.  Looking for: Underage girls legally emancipated from their parents.
You like the sexually abused love-child of Michael Jackson and Prince who can't decide if his bug-eye sunglasses are masculine enough or not. At least you have the dirty sanchez 'stache to remind people you're somewhat of a man.
I live in ATL and when its any lower than 75 degrees outside I get my Braves heavy winter jacket out from 1994. It matches my ozzy osborne glasses and wanna be hockey stud haircut really well
You should have spent the dollar you payed for that jacket at Goodwill on a cheeseburger you skinny white homeless prince looking motherfucker
He just realized taking tons of acid in a cafe was a horrible idea.
Your look screams, "Failed drug dealer looking for part-time pirate work."
You look like Prince without the fame and fortune. 
You think you're original and have your own style, but we can all tell your trying to be a gay Johnny Depp.
John Mayers homo/metrosexual and talentless, twin.   Do you bite your nails instead of the pillow?
You look like Johnny Depp and Michael Jackson had a baby and did drugs during the pregnancy
Host of Stink Master
*flam-ing    FTFY
I don't know what's older that jacket or your hairstyle. 
Put a little bit of milk on your face so your cat can lick off your mustache. 
Michael Jackson called. He does NOT want that shit back.
You're toeing a fine line between homeless and hipster 
Learn English. Because Literacy...
You look like some Stephen Tyler beef jerky.
Broke Katt Williams?
Your car has a bubbled up tinted windows, a spoiler and a shocker sticker. There are probably some energy drink stickers on there too.
john mayer minus the talent and everything we love about him
I hated tim burton's version of willy wonka. 
Stubbled carp wearing sunglasses? That's one meal I'd skip
After school sandwich artist borrows his mom's sunglasses and tries to talk like the kids at school who stuff him into his locker during PE. Roast you? No thanks. I think I'll wait until I see you in the news for molesting one of the middle schoolers that you hang out with because you can't make friends your own age.
If you sold those sunglasses you might be able to buy a real beard.
You're using those glasses to cover up your Steve Buscemi eyes.
I bet you vomit arrogance and use that as hair gel. 
You look like Prince in a Starter jacket from the Salvation Army. 
Did you have fun gluing those pubes on my face?
Who are you trying to be doctor Eggman or Boris the animal? Either way I'd still take a squash over you 
The length of your finger nails is a good representation of what girls should expect of your penis.
That rat stache is so spotted looks like justin beiber trimmed his.
The best part of this picture is the 20 bucks you spent at some thrift shop to find shitty clothing to take this picture. By fuck, that makes you some lame.
You look like a reject for a Michael Jackson biography.
Nice jacket, but you definitely look like you suck cock
Huh, Arin Hanson and Dan Avidan did have a love child.
I'm sorry, I couldn't hear what  that ghetto ass accent had to say over how bad those pubes look on your upper lip.
I feel bad roasting a homeless person.
Oh I love this game! Hipster or Homeless?
Your grandmother called. She wants her glasses back. 
You remind me of Jim Morrison, too bad you're not dead like him.
When did they get WiFi at the homeless shelter?
It's like actual used douches were put in an actual bag and then poured teenage mutant ninja turtle ooze all over it. Except this guy doesn't do karate, he just makes fun of people for not being cool like him (and not seeing the irony of him calling other people losers).
Your the "uncle" that parents warn their kids about
You look like the kind of dude that pees in the middle urinal "because you can"
that jacket from 20 years ago says otherwise.
You misspelled *Flaming
when I saw your pic I thought.. hey it's billy bob thorton's retarded younger sister she even has the same glasses and jacket! then I read your comment and though.. nope his sister is so much smarter than that!
I don't know what the purpose of those glasses are but for your sake I hope it's because you're blind.
Johnny Depp's 'special' brother. 
Roast her? This homeless woman is starving someone get her a biscuit!
Are you a hipster douchebag or a homeless junkie?  I know it's one of those.
So, are you a really feminie man, or a manly woman?
Looks like a homeless Prince wearing a starter jacket from the 90s... Yeah we're weak as fuck, but at least we can afford rent or a mortgage.
