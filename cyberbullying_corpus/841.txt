His arrogance is sky high but his iq isn't
The good thing about your cauliflower ears is that they're still more appealing than your face. And please stop throwing your shit at people through the bars, it's unbecoming.
His gums are sky high
Mouth big enough for even the largest dildo to fit in 
Mr. Ed has come back.
Ed the talking horse has a jewfro? 
You look like you have a job at your local dentist... where the dentist points at your plastic teeth to show what normal teeth look like.
Damn. James Franco was given an extra chromosome instead of an Oscar. 
Who would've guessed that chimps had arrogance 
it's hard to roast someone who's that confident even with a face full of pubes
Why did you stand in front of a giant fan to take your /roastme picture? 
Look like someones holding a leaf blower directly to his face 
How much peanut butter did you have to put on his gums to get that smile?
I've heard of a neck beard,  but neck pubes?
