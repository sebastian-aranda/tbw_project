A piece of tape was all the surgeon could do eh? Guess there are faces even plastic surgery can't fix.
First time I've seen a pig ASK to be roasted. 
Such poor camera quality? Bet the lens cracked when you look into it's eye

Cool shades man.  My parents basement is super bright too.
Did you ever think that maybe you weren't too cool for school? That maybe they kicked you out because of how poorly you were doing in your remedial classes, that they weren't even going to test you for the LD classes. They just said "fuck it, 8th grade is as far as she's getting". But hey, at least your mom is proud of you for being the first person in your family to make it past 6th grade, now all you have to beat is not having a state mandated abortion by 13 and your whole family line will be rejoicing. #beatingstatistics
