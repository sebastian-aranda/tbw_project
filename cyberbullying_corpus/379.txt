Simple Jack: The High school years
You blend in with your classmates like your camo hoodie blends in with your surroundings. 
It looks like your parents already have done their worst. 
Picture day in special ed class.   That's cute. 
If you tell me that the princess is in another castle on more time, I will kick  your fucking teeth it
You look like the dumb version of that clock terrorist. 
Let's take a second and give props to the stud in the back
Boy you look like sammyclassicsonicfan
How long have you survived on 30 cents a day?
It's like you went back in time, stole Paul McCartney's bowl cut, none of his style or talent, and then forgot how to use a comb.
I dont know whats worse, your face or your hoodie
It looks like parents already have. Ew. 
I don't know if what any one can say, can actually surpass what nature had already done
I'd say you're too fragile to handle my worst, but it looks like you've been put through some bad shit already, going by looks.
We'd do our worst but it looks like your dad beat us to the punch, literally. You look like he went seven rounds on your mother's pregnant stomach. 
Boy, you really out here looking like Howard from The Big Bang Theory. Hair dirtier than my tongue after I eat a girl's ass. And why tf your face look like an STD, fam? Smfh your barber really should be doing some time. 
Abed on meth
You will be the next involuntary suicide bomber.
You look like a poorly dressed micro phone.
Can't do any worse than your barber. 
Nature has already done that for me son. 
Is that you face or a virginity protector
If Jack-o-Lanterns could grow hair.

Hmm..what ARE you-? You look like somebody's ugly, lesbo aunt. But those front teeth..?? Jesus.  Been busy building damns down by the pond, you beaver-looking ugly fuck-? You look way, wayyyy older than you really are...but in an unattractive, unfortunate way. Is that special-Ed gorilla behind you pounding his chest in gleeful anticipation of mounting you from behind-? God, you're ugly..whatever gender, ethnicity, and species you actually are. Yeee-Uck!
Is that Abed? Is community coming back for another season?
