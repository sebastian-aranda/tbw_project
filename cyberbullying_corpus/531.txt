You look like you've had one semester left for the last 15 years
kind of looks like Steven Segal got fatter and uglier and hairier and fatter. 
You look like you've gone to jail for beating a hooker.
The fattest pigs usually get the blue ribbon before being roasted.
You look like you're going to be alone for the rest of your life, and you've accepted it. Congrats!
Sorry OP, but you won't get enough roast posts in time for this guy to penetrate your tiny asshole by last call.

He looks like the kind of guy who gets his ass kicked by the Terminator at the beginning of every movie.
Your fingers look like snausages. 
You look like a poverty-stricken [David Gest](https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/back1.jpg).
It's like if Nicholas Cage did hardcore gay bear pornography and this shot is five minutes after taking a shit on a small Vietnamese twink's face. 
Because roasting a guy who looks like he just took a shot up his ass is obviously for the benefit of all of us. Maybe *that's* why he's showing off his middle finger.

He looks like the guy that bitch seat was named for.
I didn't know Chewbacca fucked Jaba...
How is he gonna check reddit from his cardboard box?
"My Name Is Earl, I'll have seventeen big mac meals please"
You have a Pabst Blue Ribbon shirt, enough said
Keep that ankle monitor charged up Bubba, stay away from school zones. 
Chester the Molester. I've seen his picture before on telephone poles near schools--with warnings.
How's unemployment been treating you? 
You know what's easy to advertise? Alcohol. You don't have to do much of anything to get people to buy booze. However, when I look at a walking advertisement such as yourself I am reminded that drinking can often lead to poor life choices.
Soooo.. How was the SEX in Prison?
Odds are his wife is back at their trailer fucking his brother
You look like one of those guys that goes to the same bar every night hoping to insert himself into a conversation among a group of people, only to receive awkward glances from said group of people.

It's like Billy Mays had sex with the fat guy from American Pickers and then abandoned the child in front of a biker gang hangout.
how you gonna roast a guy that openly wears a pabst blue ribbon tshirt? 
How do I know this bar is within walking distance to a trailer park?
