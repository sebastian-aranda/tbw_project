"I'll make this easy"  What is things OP's mom said right before he was conceived? 
Those walls are filled with the names of people who want to sleep with you. 
Is that shat you say to the more unwilling of your rape victims?  You bald creep.
This is the face you make every time you orgasm, right?
That isn't a beard. Your hair just migrated to your face in order to raise your social status.
Did your hair just grow upside down or something?
cant tell whats more off, your head shape or your brain
You make me wish I was a far-to-the-right Republican.
Chester the molester. 
It looks like they stuck you in the furthest corner of the office so they wouldn't have to hear any more of your rants about the latest Star Trek films.  Your previous job was at a Starbucks, where you spent most of the time dwelling about how much better you were than that place.  Before that, you were a liberal arts major.  Your ultimate goal in life is to give sunburns to those who you look down upon. You've altered your glasses to just the right level of magnification in order to achieve this.
You look like you slept on your sides too much as a baby and now your head is stuck like that

Is that what your Mom said to your Dad so she could get pregnant with you?
You look like a closeted guy who fucks trannies and then writes paragraphs about how they're real women on the internet because you don't want to admit you like men.  As a cartoon dog once said, "am I in the ballpark"?
