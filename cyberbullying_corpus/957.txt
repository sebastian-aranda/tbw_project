I'm sorry to hear you weren't feeling good, I'm sure the KFC will re-open soon.
You are like a haunted house. You look scary, but I know that I can just walk away and you won't be able to catch me.
I would roast you, but I don't think you would fit in the oven. 
You look more inbred than sandwich filler. 
You look like you couldn't decide between being a serial killer or a cereal killer so you chose to be both.
I don't really want to Roast you, as diabetes is about to kick the fuck out of you.
You look like you sound like Kevin from The Office 
Are you calling the camera timer your friend?
I bet every time you get sad your wrists turn the color of that armchair.

Is that a stick in the corner?
I feel bad for the uterus you came out of 
Nice flesh turtleneck 
I believe it's I wasn't feeling too well

Porky Pig is in for a lifelong struggle  stupid sometimes cannot be avoided
It's like jabba the hut and the jokers creepy smile put together.
you look like jared from subways before picture.
You look like you're hiding several bodies in your crawlspace. 
Weren't feeling to good? I bet it was the diabeetus
Your face says run, but your body says to stand still
I need a shower after that stare!
Hey fat boy, you only are going to get fatter. 900#'s within a year or two.
