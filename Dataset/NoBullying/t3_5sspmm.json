It's been about a half of a year since she had the good sense to leave. I never hurt her physically, but I was probably abusive. And can we give up on drawing such hard lines for what that word means? I tore her and her ideals down bad; I know I did. She's way strong enough to give me the social finger and the psychological \"fuck that shit\", but pain is pain, no matter how good you are at tolerating it, getting past it, or even forgetting it. By the way, let's get this straight, it's their pain we are concerned about and that is justified, not ours. Our shame is a symptom of our shittiness, though it's convenient to fantasize about it being the cause.\n\n\nI studied culinary arts (who GAF, I know) and the attitude people have over the long standing tradition of boiling lobsters is this: You boil them, pain for them is different from what we think of as pain because of nervous system differences BS, so why think about it, and then they die and we get to forget about what they might have felt... Whatever pain you caused her, accept it. I mean really rub that shit in your eyes and feel it dawg. That's not shame or guilt for the sake of indulgence, despite how right it feels. That is you ever so slightly making the world better by starting with yourself. It feels right because that shit is the literal definition of righteousness. So live it. Feel it. I mean dip your hand all the way to the bottom of that pot, touch the bottom and brag to your friends, soak in it like a jacussi, and really feel what it is you made another feel, and **never** do whatever it is you did again (and by and by I won't either). \n\n\nBut let's be real, if I was so blind to my dumbfuckery a half a year ago, what could I possibly see now? It's like perceptions of myself have been distorted by insecurities. And those insecurities all revolve around my value in society, but more specifically, to those I personally hold as valuable. I dare say that in fact I actually feel *ashamed*. And that's how (at least for me) I know I'm headed somewhere that I need to go.\n\n\nI can only even think back to or remember the times I was terrible at this point. Maybe because drugs have fucked up my memory, maybe because I was just that bad. Maybe it's the same for you? Maybe it won't be like that later on, or maybe it will be? How you might relate to that doesn't matter so much, I'm really talking about me in this moment (sorry for the narcissism).  So many good memories I had with her (maybe that we shared? I might be horrible for even claiming or mentioning that good times or love could have existed - whether they were worth it to her or not). \n\n\nHere's what I'm getting at. Don't accept who you were brother/sister/other. As of the time I'm writing this, your post is 9 hours old. If we are in this same skipper as I suspect, you've been thinking about her for 9 hours straight. Hell, maybe you see this tomorrow, you might have dreamed of her. Maybe you fantazised about apologizing to her while doing other stuff throughout the entire day. And this time, apologized \"the right way\" right?. Either way she's in your mind isn't she? For anyone else out there reading this, maybe your family, friends, and/or loved ones are your minds and you've not forgotten what you did?\n\n\nThat's 9 hours penance you paid, BuoyantArmiger. NOT because you deserve to be miserable, but because you deserve to learn. It's the only way the world gets better. We ALL deserve to learn when we fuck up, homie. In fact, that's the one thing no one - not even the shittiest imagineable version of you - could ever take away. \n\n\nBut something might feel like an injustice in your mind like it feels for me right now. In fact, I'm bringing it up just because it feels so wrong - in fact, it feels dirty to keep the thought a secret. Maybe, even when we wrong people in the worst way, they have no power, authority, right, or priviledge to take away our opportunity or ability to change. Our lives keep stumbling forward, but change itself is an unstoppable consequence within each stumble. And to be honest yo, let's pretend it's you and I sitting under a tree looking over the valley at the people we did wrong. I know, I'm drunk and we don't know each other or our respective social circles at all. But imagine them as people that we might both agree to be like people in general. They probably *would* perfer that we would be different; and perhaps they *would*, if possible, choose for us to change. \n\n\nAccepting who you are is safe, but it's only safe for you. You might not end someones life by that acceptence, but you're giving up on the chance to make that same life better than you would have otherwise.
