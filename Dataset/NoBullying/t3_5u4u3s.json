But I don't play competitively (Is playing against AI taboo?) I also have a PS3 so I can play Borderlands 1&amp;amp;2 on occasion. I occasionally speedrun Super Mario 64 as it's my favorite game of all time. Fire Emblem is also one of my favorites series, currently playing FE Awakening!\n\nAnime: I watch quite a bit of anime. Most genres are fine with me as I've had favorites from different categories. Most notable for me have been Rurouni Kenshin, Nisekoi, Angel Beats, Date A Live, One  Punch Man and Michiko &amp;amp; Hatchin. I should also note that I love Ghibli movies like Nausicaa, Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke, Howl's Moving Castle and Castle In The Sky.\n\nFitness: This was something I had been working on a while back and had managed to lose some weight as I was working out with my dad. When he passed away, I kept it up for a bit then stopped as I found it difficult to continue since my main support wasn't there any more. I thought it best to pick it up again recently as it has heleped my anxiety out quite a bit.\n\nSchool: I'm aspiring to be a graphic designer, and hope I can apply it in video game design or even better work at Studio Ghibli, who knows. I start in the summer knocking away the rest of Gen Ed.\n\nEnough about me though.

I love the darebee workouts and I try and do them 4 times a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dn&amp;#39;D, scifi movies, and superheroes. I&amp;#39;ve got a TOTAL weak spot for Steve Rogers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exploring cities and finding those cool niche bars and restaurants&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Art! I graduated with a degree in Art Education (and then decided I didn&amp;#39;t want to be a teacher, go figure!) so I love, love, love painting, sketching, sewing, and artistic work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Making people happy &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m hesitantly starting to make my own clothes. If you have any suggestions for pattern sites or general tips, let me know!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Music! Give me any music suggestion pls! I will listen to them and give you feedback. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shows like Bob&amp;#39;s Burgers, Parks n&amp;#39; Rec, Brooklyn 99, The Office, The IT Crowd, and the new My Brother, My Brother and Me program. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I love talking to people about things they&amp;#39;re passionate about! Do you have a niche hobby or show or band you love? Tell me why you love them!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I! overuse! Exclamation! Points!! And am a huge goofball. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you read all of this, thank you!!

I'm Emily, and I'm 21 years old.\n\n\nYou can find [my last post here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wholesomememes/comments/5r6gyb/wholesome_memes_official_find_a_friend_thread_3/ddb3e12/) A couple of people decided to say hello last time, so I thought I'd post again!\n\n\nWhen I made that first post I was feeling pretty bad. A couple of years ago I decided to go to a different college, in a different state, than all my friends from home. That was a pretty lonely choice, even if it was maybe the right one, and I still haven't really made any friends here. But the messages of support I got after my last post have made me feel a little better about the whole thing!\n\n\nWith that out of the way, here is how I spend my time:\n\n\n* Reading reddit, and posting on reddit, which is why I'm using this throwaway to talk about how lonely I am\n* Playing video games, especially Hearthstone and Overwatch - my favorite deck is C'thun Druid and my favorite hero is Lucio!\n* Listening to music, I like a whole lot of everything, but I've been on a bit of a classic rock binge lately\n* Writing, or at least I used to, but I haven't managed to put words to paper on a story for a while\n\n\nMy major is history, and I adore it. I know talking about academic stuff isn't for everyone, but if you're out there and you like hearing cool things about history, we should definitely be friends.\n\n\nI hope we have something to talk about! If we do, please shoot me a PM. Or just reply here. Even if we don't, it would be wonderful to say hi. As I said in my last post, I really love this place, and I'm super grateful for all the positivity here &lt;3", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey &lt;a href=\"/r/wholesomememes\"&gt;/r/wholesomememes&lt;/a&gt;, it&amp;#39;s me again.

Just the other day, I picked up *Blindness* by Jos\u00e9 Saramago. I haven't started it yet, but I hear it's really good. \n\n* TV/Netflix - Again, not avid, but once I find something, can't stop. I've seen *Breaking Bad*, *Stranger Things*, *The IT Crowd*, half of *Malcolm in the Middle*, and way too many comedy specials to count. Currently, I'm on Season 2 of *Orange Is The New Black*. Pretty good so far.\n* Talking about movies, video games, and books - Usually, when I finish any piece of media, I feel like talking to other people about it because I think it's cool to talk about how something works or doesn't work as entertainment, especially if it had a major impact on me as a person.\n\nThat's pretty much it for now.

I&amp;#39;m RandomObject_Number.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a 21-year-old, male, American Communications student with a focus on film production.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here are some of my interests:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Movies (you probably guessed that) - My favorite kinds of movies are beautiful to watch and somewhat hard to comprehend. Stuff like Stanley Kubrick, David Lynch, Andrei Tarkovsky, etc. I&amp;#39;m really rooting for &lt;em&gt;Arrival&lt;/em&gt; at the Oscars this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Video Games - I&amp;#39;m more into single-player games, but I play Rocket League and CS:GO on occasion. Right now, though, I&amp;#39;m in the middle of playing Resident Evil 4 for the millionth time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Books - I wouldn&amp;#39;t say I&amp;#39;m an avid reader, but when I find a book I like, I can&amp;#39;t stop until I finish it (or at least until I have to work on something else, in which case I stop, forget where I left off, and have to start over again). Just the other day, I picked up &lt;em&gt;Blindness&lt;/em&gt; by Jos\u00e9 Saramago. I haven&amp;#39;t started it yet, but I hear it&amp;#39;s really good. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;TV/Netflix - Again, not avid, but once I find something, can&amp;#39;t stop. I&amp;#39;ve seen &lt;em&gt;Breaking Bad&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The IT Crowd&lt;/em&gt;, half of &lt;em&gt;Malcolm in the Middle&lt;/em&gt;, and way too many comedy specials to count. Currently, I&amp;#39;m on Season 2 of &lt;em&gt;Orange Is The New Black&lt;/em&gt;. Pretty good so far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talking about movies, video games, and books - Usually, when I finish any piece of media, I feel like talking to other people about it because I think it&amp;#39;s cool to talk about how something works or doesn&amp;#39;t work as entertainment, especially if it had a major impact on me as a person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s pretty much it for now.

I tend not to love long, mainstream serialized stuff like Friends or Scrubs, but hopefully that doesn't make me sound elitist. Also I enjoy anime a good deal when I get around to watching it. My favorites are Berserk, Baccano and Samurai Champloo.\n\nGames: As much as I try to diversify my gaming interests, I tend to enjoy RPGs more than any other genre, so I waffle between playing them and trying to get into other ones. I also really admire the Souls games, although Ive only played two of them. I tend to end up watching let's plays of them a lot. My favorite game is probably Shadow of the Colossus. Basically I love anything with a strong aesthetic, visual or otherwise.

I don't really love \"literary\", award bait fiction all that much, but I don't tend to like potboilery fiction stuff like Harry Potter or the Hunger games either (although I do have a soft spot for traditional fantasy), so I end up reading a lot of popcorn type entertainment with a good sense of craft.
