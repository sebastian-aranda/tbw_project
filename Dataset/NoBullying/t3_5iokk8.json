I'm no Star Wars expert, but I just want to express a few thoughts and feelings that I had. \n\nConsider that the Rebels are always the underdogs in the original trilogy.

As bad as the Empire was and despite the Rebels being portrayed as the good guys, they are still technically terrorists. The average person would probably be in shock and wouldn't really believe the following reports that it was mostly thanks to a space wizard with super powers. \n\nIf your home government was overthrown by a far off, ragtag army made of rebels, would you be inclined to believe the following reports that it was thanks to a guy who had a laser rifle and could shoot ice from his hands? You would probably be skeptical and even so, there are more pressing concerns.

As someone else suggested their propaganda was probably pretty powerful.\n\nAnyway, that's just my take on things.
