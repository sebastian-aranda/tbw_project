We were both on the swim team and I was also in the band. I had very good grades and hers were even better, she was a 4.0+ student. Now, the day that I asked this girl to be my girlfriend was great, I had known her for a while and known a little bit about her background. This girl had dated a few guys before but had always kept it on the down-low. I never thought anything of it. We were at a swim meet one day and at this point I had already kissed her once. I really liked this girl and she started talking to me saying a sentence about how she felt it went along the lines of Her: \"Hey, I kinda wanted to talk to you about...this...and..\" Me interrupting: \"will you go out with me?\" She was ecstatic. She actually went to go ask her dad. At this point she was telling me about how her dad had never known she had dated anybody so I was extremely scared because he didn't want her dating. This was the first time she had ever asked him if she could and this time he actually said yes! So I had the most awkward conversation with him and, well, I met him. He seemed fine. I had dated girls before and learned how to meet parents. However something was different. This girl, when she was around 8 her parents divorced because her mother was an alcoholic and the dad received custody. So Danielle and him moved to California. At this time she had a step mom. Still has the same step mom today. We dated for a while and I wanted to take her to prom, but her dad was so controlling. She had to put her phone on the kitchen counter at 9pm every night and her dad would look through all her messages and then look up her messages on the computer through the phone company. This guy was crazy. Anyway I minded the rules, whatever and there was a weekend when I talked to her until 3am because her dad was out of town. Now a few days later i called him in person to ask if I could take her to prom, and he said \"see if she wants to go.\" So on the day of the biggest swim meet I took everybody's fins, willingly, and placed them in a way to spell \"Prom?\" Every swim team in the school district was there watching and the huge aww of an audience was given when she walked out of changing room to freak out and say yes. Her dad was completely pissed that I had asked her to prom. He apparently wanted me to find out without asking. On the day of prom I picked her up in my car and her dad and step mom followed behind us all the way there so they could make sure we were actually going to prom. Those tickets are 150 damn dollars. PROM WAS AWESOME! Best night we had together. We grew very close and I loved her, I still love her. It was time for me to graduate. The day before my graduation she doesn't show up to school. I text her three times that day asking where she was and the whole day I got no responses. Our school took our senior portrait, I got my graduation gown, I walked into the swim team room and got tackled by the whole swim team because I was varsity captain. I went into the band room and the same thing happened. I sat down and talked with my friends and got a text message. The message said this. From Danielle: \"This is Danielle's dad. You cannot see my daughter anymore. You have not been nice to our family and you are messing with my daughter's life. Do not call, do not reply we do not want to hear from you.\" I broke out in tears and threw my phone across the room.  I ran outside when I could bear it and called them back right away. Her dad ACTUALLY PICKED UP! I asked him why??? And he told me I had repeatedly lied to them. Turns out he checked her messages online and found out we were talking until 1am that one night and hated me for it. A day after I graduated I visited the school. She ran up to me and kissed me. She didn't want that and it was all her dad. She was at home after school ended that week and told him that I met her at school. She didn't care. They had a yelling argument and it ended with the last straw for her. He said: \"If you're so unhappy here why don't you just go back to Virginia with your mom!\" So she thought about it for a while and actually said said okay and the next semester she was living with her mother and going to school out there. She now goes to Virginia Tech and I still talk to her every week. That's my story of a controlling parent becoming too much and causing more than anybody wanted. It's been four years since this happened and we still talk all the time. It's like $400 for a plane ticket to go see her and come back but I'm too much of a poor college student to afford it. I would very much love to take the time and money to see her again in person. I even got her a promise ring a while ago but I was too scared to give it to her. Still have it in my garage. We haven't been dating all this time either. When she moved we decided that we wouldn't be in a long distance relationship. We've both dated a few people since ten but never for a really long time and we end up talking to each other about the faults of the person we are dating. That's not a good thing for a relationship, I know. But hey she can still make me laugh and smile whenever she wants to from so far away. I live in Los Angeles, I go to school in Phoenix and she lives and goes to school in Virginia. I'm almost 22 and she's almost 20.  Can't wait for the day I can see her again really, but it will have to wait. Becoming an engineer takes time. She's in journalism now and she always calls me to re-read her articles :) I'm gonna stop now.
