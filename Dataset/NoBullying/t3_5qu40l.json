I think my thread is still up somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway some asshole starts harassing me and shockingly several people came to defend me, I don&amp;#39;t remember all the details anymore just that it made me miserable for a while. Later on a reddit thread I mentioned it and I got at least ten or more people PMing me or answering to offer a listening ear or some support, someone even sent me a picture of their cat :) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am an abuse survivor, and currently in a situation of abuse again, but if anything keeps me going, its people showing that I don&amp;#39;t need to explain myself anymore, I&amp;#39;m not always alone. And there are others like me out there who feel the most alone now, but really aren&amp;#39;t. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "stickied": false, "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "wholesomememes", "score_hidden": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "name": "t1_dd3f3kc", "created": 1485804859.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1485776059.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wholesomememes", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3gcwj", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5qu40l", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dd2me89", "banned_at_utc": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "aarghIforget", "can_mod_post": false, "ups": 6, "parent_id": "t3_5qu40l", "score": 6, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "I'm choosing to read that title in a Steve Martin voice: \"one ~wild and wholesome~ guy!\"", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": "16", "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m choosing to read that title in a Steve Martin voice: &amp;quot;one ~wild and wholesome~ guy!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "stickied": false, "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "wholesomememes", "score_hidden": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "name": "t1_dd2me89", "created": 1485756907.0, "author_flair_text": "", "created_utc": 1485728107.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wholesomememes", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3gcwj", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5qu40l", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3gcwj", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5qu40l", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dd3ihje", "banned_at_utc": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "jexx30", "can_mod_post": false, "ups": 2, "parent_id": "t1_dd3faqk", "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "This is very valuable advice.
