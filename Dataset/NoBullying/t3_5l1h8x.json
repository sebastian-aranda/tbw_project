I had one year where I took only 1 class per semester for my health, and then I took a full year's break. I'm back in now, taking 2 classes/semester, and I'm graduating magna cum laude in May. I'll also be 60k in debt but... that's a bridge I'll cross when I get there. There are options for people with no income, so I try not to let myself stress it. I honestly wouldn't trade my education for the world, though. When I took a break from school, I didn't think I was going back. I know I'm not getting  a job out of my degree, so I thought I should just cut my losses, financially. I'm glad I changed my mind, but I'm also really glad that I took the break.\n\nAs to working... that's one that I haven't reached peace on, myself. I own a small online tea shop (shameless plug: http://spot-of-tea.com) that brings in a handful of dollars now and again and requires almost no maintenance. I've tried working traditional jobs, but I can't keep reliable hours, so while I nail interviews and can *get* a job easily, I can't keep them. I'm looking into applying for disability again, now that I have documentation from numerous medical professionals (thank god for state insurance, let me tell you). But I often feel burdensome and leech-y because I don't have what society dictates as a \"useful\" role. I just try to remember that people's worth is not based in their GDP, but in who they are as a person.\n\nMaking friends and dating... dating is another hard thing, particularly online dating. It's quite shallow, and feels like it's all about what you have to offer, and when you're a pudgy depressed adult with no job who lives at home, it feels like a charming personality and quick wit doesn't really outweigh that. I also have high standards, which means that okcupid and the like are just not fruitful for me. I just don't recommend doing online dating at all, honestly, but YMMV.\n\nMaking friends, on the other hand, that's different. You really only need to make one friend to make a bunch of friends. All the irl friends I have right now are classmates or people that I met because I knew one person and started hanging out with their friends group. Also, don't discount online communities. A lot of people dismiss online-only relationships as subpar or \"not real friendships\" but that's absolutely not true. I mentioned that I play GW2 - and through the 4 years it's been out, it's contributed monumentally to my social interaction. It's free to play now, by the way, so if you decide to pick it up, let me know and I'll send you a guild invite. ;D But regardless, finding an online community where you belong definitely helps.\n\nRegarding vacations and everything else really: it's about managing expectations, and your energy. If you go camping with your friends, make sure they know you can't do hiking two days in a row, but you don't mind staying in the tent and reading while they go out (and if they want to stay behind and play card games with you, more's the better!). Make sure you don't overextend yourself so that you have some energy in reserve for whatever else might come up.\n\nIn my experience, allowing yourself to take the breaks that you need and letting your friends know your limitations results in a much happier and more comfortable life. And you can do more than you think you can. Sometimes it's worth pushing past your limits a bit to get a valuable experience (ie - a vacation).\n\nEverything else comes down to philosophy, and learning to appreciate what's good in your life/not comparing your life to others'. Easier said than done, of course, but here's an exercise I use:\n\nWrite out everything that's wrong with your life. Be as miserable as you want. \"I'm overweight. I'm 31 and live with my mom. Sometimes I can't even get out of bed for days because of my migraines. I'm in terrible debt because of student loans.\" etc etc. \n\nNow, rewrite the whole thing, replacing each sentence with something that's good about that misfortune: \"I have more than enough food to eat. I get to spend time every week with my mother, who I love, where many adults my age don't get to. I have a very comfortable bed, and people who will help care for me when I'm incapacitated - plus, I really appreciate the days that I am pain-free and can do things outside of the house. I have an education in a field that interests me, that has helped me to grow as an individual beyond that which I could have achieved alone.\"\n\nThis is getting really long, sorry about that. To wrap up: it'll never be perfect. There will always be bad days, there will always be things that you struggle with. But remembering what's good, and adding more positive things (people, hobbies, etc) will help with that. Be nice to yourself. Let yourself rest, let yourself be sad - but also push your boundaries when it feels good to do so, and cheer yourself up when it feels good to do so. Do what feels good at the time, even if it's not what you're \"supposed\" to be doing.\n\nAnd message me if you ever wanna talk. &lt;3", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of it is that I was lucky.

Where a meme would normally say &amp;quot;tfw you&amp;#39;re broke but [something nihilistic]&amp;quot; and it gets changed to &amp;quot;tfw you&amp;#39;re broke but [you can spend time with your friends and loved ones without spending a dime, and that makes you rich.]&amp;quot; I find myself doing that, mentally. &amp;quot;I have to zip up my boots, but bending down hurts. [But it is a comparatively small task, and I am capable of handling it because I&amp;#39;m strong enough.]&amp;quot; sort of thing. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, sorry for rambling. Hope you guys are all having a wonderful and cheery day!    &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "stickied": false, "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "wholesomememes", "score_hidden": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "name": "t1_dbstyfo", "created": 1483147009.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1483118209.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wholesomememes", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3gcwj", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5l1h8x", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3gcwj", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5l1h8x", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3gcwj", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5l1h8x", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3gcwj", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5l1h8x", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dbsk1df", "banned_at_utc": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "FixinThePlanet", "can_mod_post": false, "ups": 5, "parent_id": "t1_dbsb4n7", "score": 5, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "Chicago in the winter is gorgeous and cold and wet.

I never cared for school and when I did I wasn't the best with mediocre grades. I always remember seeing my parents talk about people being gay and how they're lowlife or creepy, especially my dad talked like that, which lead me to not even feel comfortable around him since I'm gay. \n\n Years later we moved again, thankfully in the same town so I still had friends, I started having a lot of physical problems, turns out I had a few disease, one of which being Scoliosis, a spinal disease. That threw me into a depression at the age of 15, and made me even more reclusive where I barely left the house besides school, and when I did I was incredibly self-conscious. I remember trying to wear a hoodie in the middle of summer because I was worried what people would think about me. Later that year, while playing vidya games, I found a guy and we started talking, few months later we showed interest in one another. To make this segment of my life short it was essentially; when I was 16 he was 19, I loved him a lot. We got into an argument, split and moved on. It threw me into another even greater depression, lost almost all my friends and only talked to one person for about a year and a half, who was also friends with my now ex. My friend told me that my ex was cheating on me, and I found out that he got engaged to the girl he was cheating with a month after our break up.\n\n So after knowing all that and going on with life I just lived each day wondering what to do. I didn't even bother to go to high school making me not even go in the first place, not very smart and still hung over someone from the past. I don't know where it happened, but years later now at 19, I just decided to look at life different. While my heart still hurts and memories still exist, I decide to make peace with it. I started to figure out what the problem of my sadness was or what was making me mad and solve the issue. If I couldn't then I would just fill it with something else like games or books, or I'd force myself to become social with other people. Life slowly started to get better, I don't look at the negatives as much anymore and more so the happy things.\n\n Life is still rough though. I'm still in the closet but hey, no one but myself needs to know yet. I don't have a steady job but I have my family to lean on a little. I didn't finish high school, or well start it, but I got my GED instead. I wanted to join the military but I can't due to poor eye sight, RA and Scoliosis but I got my sights on other things. Real estate was an interest in mine, even beginning to get my Real Estate License, but I put that on hold since I don't think I have enough experience to go in such a difficult job. So I moved to another avenue. \n\n Realistically right now if I were to look at life the way I did a few years ago, I'd be utterly upset on how much of a 'failure' I am, but I don't because I'm 19 and still young. Instead I decided I'll carve my own path through blood, sweat and tears. Literally. I started to slowly build my own clothing brand and get connected with more people who are doing the same. I take this moment of my life as a learning experience, everything that is bad that is going on in my life is another day lived. To know I'm living near the lowest of the low, and then I usher forward to something greater next. \n\n This might have been a long and drawn out story, but this is a few things that I smile to when I think back that I'm glad I've experienced. I hope you can smile back on your past too, and if you can't, you got tomorrow and the next day after that to make memories.

Sorry. I'll try to condense the best I can. \n\nI grew up in an abusive household, parents made an enemy with an elementary shool PE teacher who in turn abused me as a way to dig at them. I was \"home schooled\" for a while (which meant I just stayed at home with mom and did chores all day, not school work). Three years later went back to public school, but because I was behind in education, parents said I made the family look bad and stepped up abuse. I was suicidal and a cutter. A year later, my dad retired from work (I have much older parents, I was a menopause fuck up) and had two heart attacks. A few months later, mom is diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer. Working in the farm and the cattle becomes a much heavier burden on me. Elder sibling (15 years older than I) is an alcoholic, has never left home, works a mediocre job, pays others to attempt his college classes for him, and complains my life is too easy. Every time he complains, life becomes harder. \n\nAt this point, every \"free\" moment is dedicated to either the farms or rushing a parent to the ER due to declining health. No time for homework, which leads to bad grades, which just repeats a never ending cycle. High school begins. Mom is basically an invalid due to surgeries, not doing physical therapy, chemo, and other factors. I am to wait on her hand and foot. I am granted some time for study as to not embarrass the family. I have no friends, I truly wonder why everyone is so happy since life was so shitty (I figured my life was typical and everyones parents beat them for screwing up). I get through to senior year where my mental health just shatters. I just don't care anymore. Mom has a seizure the week after I graduate and it's found a brain tumor has formed. I'm 18. I leave. I use all my scholarship money as a deposit/first/last for an apartment half of the state away. Sibling visits tells me I'm a selfish cow and mom is dying and I need to go take care of her. I don't. I move a little closer to home a year later because of the job market (it's 06 and the market is starting to plummet). I get into a relationship with a man who is abusive. I'm in it for many, many years. I think it is normal. This is how life is. A few years ago, mom died. I'm told it's my fault for not taking care of her. That I'm a selfish bitch. \n\nWhat little mental stability I had raked back together, flutters away. A concerned coworker recommends I speak to a \"very nice doctor\" who helped her a lot after her mom died. What the hell, it'll get me out of the house for an hour, I figured. He helps me in a few sessions to reevaluate life. I see that this isn't how life is, that I was so used to abuse that it's what I sought out. I grew stronger, mentally. I began looking at life from the perspective he suggested. We're a few years out from that now and while shit had happened (got misdiagnosed with something which has left me in a great deal of medical debt, I've changed jobs, can't really afford a whole lot with the debt and all), I've got a pretty good life now. I have a stable job (though my users annoy me from time to time and my co-workers make me give them a wtf look lol), I have a working vehicle (which is a nice truck that I've been able to help people with moving and such from time to time), I have whatever food I want on my plate (reasonably priced), I get to enjoy my hobbies (video games, reading, cosplay), I have a wonderful new boyfriend (who treats me so well it's absolutely ridiculous but I love every minute and am so thankful for it), he has a wonderful rescue pup (who has his own issues from his former abusive home, which just endears me to him more. He likes to give me kisses and snuggle with me. I love him to pieces), and while I still have some pretty severe anxiety - I don't feel it's necessary to be medicated for it any more. I can manage it (most of the time). And my depression I've been working through pretty well lately. I've got my AA now and hopefully I can start on my bachelor's in 2018. I hope to one day get a doctorate's degree in technology. In the meanwhile, my boyfriend has been buying tickets for me to experience things I always wanted to but never could. His mom and dad have \"adopted\" me and expect me round every holiday. While my life hasnt been the greatest up to this point, it's looking like when I start my 30s in a few months - it'll be the brightest point in my life so far. \n\nTl;dr: life was abusive and shit for most of it through near the end of the 20s. now, near the eve of the beginning of my 30s, it's looking fabulous.

Sorry. I&amp;#39;ll try to condense the best I can. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I grew up in an abusive household, parents made an enemy with an elementary shool PE teacher who in turn abused me as a way to dig at them. I was &amp;quot;home schooled&amp;quot; for a while (which meant I just stayed at home with mom and did chores all day, not school work). Three years later went back to public school, but because I was behind in education, parents said I made the family look bad and stepped up abuse. I was suicidal and a cutter. A year later, my dad retired from work (I have much older parents, I was a menopause fuck up) and had two heart attacks. A few months later, mom is diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer. Working in the farm and the cattle becomes a much heavier burden on me. Elder sibling (15 years older than I) is an alcoholic, has never left home, works a mediocre job, pays others to attempt his college classes for him, and complains my life is too easy. Every time he complains, life becomes harder. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At this point, every &amp;quot;free&amp;quot; moment is dedicated to either the farms or rushing a parent to the ER due to declining health. No time for homework, which leads to bad grades, which just repeats a never ending cycle. High school begins.
