If we go purely by Christian beliefs, God is perfect, right? But man is flawed. The Bible is supposed to be the word of God but it was still written by man, who is flawed. So I believe not everything included in the Bible is accurate. It was also written from their perspective, in their time, in their culture, with their science, which is obviously much different from the modern day. There have also been mistranslations and other discrepancies. Much of the Bible is also highly metaphorical. I believe Genesis is HIGHLY metaphorical and actually describes (albeit inaccurately), the process of evolution. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My point in all this is that the Bible isn&amp;#39;t perfect and some things within it are flat out wrong or don&amp;#39;t really apply to our modern era. This is a controversial topic among Christians, but it doesn&amp;#39;t mean it isn&amp;#39;t true. The key point of Christianity is believing that Jesus died on the cross for our sins, thus leading to our salvation. Accepting the entirety of the Bible is not a requirement for salvation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not a theologian so I apologize if this seems a bit rambly. Religion is an extremely personal thing that is unique to each individual.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "stickied": false, "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "wholesomememes", "score_hidden": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "name": "t1_daod3rg", "created": 1480664565.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1480635765.0, "ups": 650, "depth": 6, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3gcwj", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5fxnac", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3gcwj", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5fxnac", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3gcwj", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5fxnac", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "daokiso", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "score": 60, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Scarbane", "parent_id": "t1_daofy2f", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wholesomememes", "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "\"Judas, were you trying to split the atom?\" said the Lord.\n\nJudas replied \"Psh, no way, Jesus.

Considering how little we know and understand, even if you ascribe to a particular belief system can you &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; write off other belief systems completely? How about &amp;quot;dead&amp;quot; religions, like the Norse gods or the Roman gods? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whatever you may believe, I strongly suspect you don&amp;#39;t hold out some partial plausibility for the vast majority of belief systems even though your rationale that &amp;quot;we just don&amp;#39;t know&amp;quot; applies to them as well. You don&amp;#39;t believe those things because you have no reason to, and furthermore you actually probably feel you have good reason to suspect those systems are outright wrong, because you have no reason to suspect there is any truth to them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is how atheists feel, except instead of limiting the &amp;quot;I have no reason to believe this is true&amp;quot; to particular belief systems, they extend it to all religions. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When someone calls themselves an atheist, they are not saying &amp;quot;If I were presented with real evidence that god existed, I would reject it.&amp;quot; I think everyone, atheists included, would go completely insane if such evidence were ever produced. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "stickied": false, "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "wholesomememes", "score_hidden": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "name": "t1_daoeb59", "created": 1480668152.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1480639352.0, "ups": 8, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3gcwj", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5fxnac", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 1, "name": "t1_daohb3k", "id": "daohb3k", "parent_id": "t1_daog78b", "depth": 4, "children": ["daohb3k"]}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "daog78b", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "score": 9, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Ilikedogs11", "parent_id": "t1_dao49df", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wholesomememes", "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I always thought if religious people can believe that God created itself ..
