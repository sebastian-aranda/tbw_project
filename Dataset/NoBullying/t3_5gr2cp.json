Humour from a good place is more difficult, but has an entirely different feeling. \n\nI'm just looking for an example to relate to, but I think the best comparison is the type of humour the Muppets typically has (discounting the bloopers, lol). It's humour that makes fun of no one person or group except those of negativity, and even then, there's the connotation that they're misguided instead of stupid or evil. One of the reasons I think dark humour is so funny is that there's the added factor that you shouldn't really be laughing at the topics involved, by whatever moral standards you adhere to (yes yes, south park is fresh in my mind, I know). It's almost an easier way of writing humour, because, by that logic, the person reading the humour is doing a portion of the work of the comedian. I will say that more positive humour is harder to make funny by comparison, as I don't find myself getting into laughing fits like I do with darker humour, it's more the muted \"nose breath\" thing, but I started to appreciate the simplicity of it today. It's not loud or boisturous, but it's just that muted feeling of \"good\". \n\nI realized I was relating to the memes in this sub by thinking about the good people in my life, my family and pets at home (dog memes are good memes), and [this one](http://i.imgur.com/3YTp4Dz.jpg) even made me have a moment and really think about my boyfriend.

I think he's worth it, more than worth it, and that's why we're doing it. It was a fact we both agreed on and that I knew wholeheartedly, but I felt I really came to terms with it for the first time, and it's been months of back and forth. I just felt good about it. And in a way, I kinda reached that 'cause of a fucking 4-line meme, but hey, means to an end and all. \n\nSo yeah, walls of text are my thing. This one happened because I'm just happy this sub exists, or because I took a day off to get stoned, or probably a bit of both.
